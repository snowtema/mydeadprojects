## C.3.1 - U.Kind & SubkindOf (Core)

> **One‑line summary.** Defines **`U.Kind`** as a **minimal, context‑local intensional carrier** for “what a claim is about,” and **`U.SubkindOf (⊑)`** as a **partial order** over kinds. **Kinds do not carry Scope.** Scope remains on **claims/capabilities** (USM). This core pattern supplies only identity, locality, and ordering; **intent & membership** (`KindSignature`, `Extension/MemberOf`) are specified in **C.3.2**, bridges & congruence in **C.3.3**, masks in **C.3.4**, and the AT facet in **C.3.5**.

**Status.** Normative in **Part C**. Identifier **C.3.1**.
**Audience.** Engineering managers, architects, assurance leads.

**Dependencies.**

* **A.2.6 USM (Unified Scope Mechanism).** *Scope* is a set‑valued **USM property** over `U.ContextSlice` on **claims/capabilities**; algebra: `∈` (membership), `∩` (intersection), `SpanUnion` (union across independent lines), `translate` (scope mapping).
* **C.2.2 F–G–R.** F = formality of expression; **G = Claim scope**; R = assurance/evidence; weakest‑link for F/R; CL penalties feed **R**, not **F/G**.
* **C.2.3 U.Formality (F).** Ordinal F0…F9; no arithmetic; applies to all content, including Kind signatures (defined in **C.3.2**).
* **Part B Bridges & CL.** Generic (scope) bridges and CL; **Kind bridges** are specialized in **C.3.3**.

**Non‑goals.**

* No data governance or repository/notation mandates.
* No membership or signature semantics here (defined in **C.3.2**).
* No Cross‑context mapping/congruence here (defined in **C.3.3**).
* No role/mask mechanics here (defined in **C.3.4**).
* No AT facet mechanics here (defined in **C.3.5**).

### C.3.1:1 - Purpose & Audience

This pattern gives **one small, stable vocabulary** to say *what* a claim ranges over (its **describedEntity**) without entangling that with *where it applies* (Scope) or *how well it is supported* (R). For managers:

* It prevents the costly mistake “more abstract wording ⇒ wider scope.”
* It enables **typed composition** (you cannot combine claims about incompatible “things”).
* It keeps **Scope** and **Assurance** math unchanged and predictable.


### C.3.1:2 - Context

across Contexts, “type” means OWL class, SHACL shape, code type, BORO category, etc. A **neutral, minimal** object is needed to name *the kind of entities* a claim quantifies over **without** importing a full type system or altering USM. **`U.Kind`** fills that role; **ordering** between kinds captures “is‑a/refines” relationships a Context relies on.


### C.3.1:3 - Problem

1. **Scope–Type conflation.** Teams broaden G by “abstracting” prose, not by adding supported slices.
2. **Unsafe composition.** Claims are joined though they talk about different “things.”
3. **Cross‑context drift.** Without an explicit core notion of kind, bridges blur describedEntity vs applicability.


### C.3.1:4 - Forces

| Force                          | Tension to resolve                                                        |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Minimality vs utility**      | Keep the core tiny yet sufficient for composition and governance.         |
| **Locality vs reuse**          | Kinds are context‑local, but projects reuse claims across Contexts via bridges. |
| **describedEntity vs applicability** | Ordering should not leak into Scope; kinds must not carry G.              |
| **Neutrality vs specificity**  | Avoid committing to any particular type/ontology stack or notation.       |


### C.3.1:5 - Solution — Core Objects (overview)

* **`U.Kind`** — a **context‑local intensional** object naming a “kind of thing” claims may quantify over.
* **`U.SubkindOf (⊑)`** — a **partial order** on kinds (reflexive, transitive, antisymmetric). `k₁ ⊑ k₂` reads “`k₁` refines `k₂`.”

> **No Scope on kinds.** Scope is for **claims/capabilities** (USM). Kinds supply **describedEntity only**; **membership** and **signature** live in **C.3.2**.


### C.3.1:6 - Norms & Invariants (normative)

**C3.1‑K‑01 (Partial order).** `U.SubkindOf (⊑)` **SHALL** be a **partial order** on `U.Kind`: reflexive, transitive, antisymmetric. Editors **SHALL** document any Context‑specific meets/joins if they supply them (optional).

**C3.1‑K‑02 (No Scope on kinds).** A `U.Kind` **MUST NOT** carry a Scope value. Scope lives with **claims** (`U.ClaimScope` = **G**) and **capabilities** (`U.WorkScope`) per **A.2.6**.
*Rationale pointer:* see **C.3.2** for the **intent/extent vs Scope** split.

**C3.1‑K‑03 (Identity & locality).** A `U.Kind` is **context‑local**. Cross‑context mapping of kinds is handled by **KindBridge** (see **C.3.3**); such mapping **MUST NOT** be conflated with Scope bridging.

**C3.1‑K‑04 (Naming).** A Context **SHALL** assign stable identifiers to kinds and **SHOULD** catalog parent/child `⊑` links. Synonyms/aliases **SHALL** point to the canonical kind id.

**C3.1‑K‑05 (Separation of concerns).** This core **does not** define kind intent or membership; those are specified in **C.3.2** (`KindSignature` with its own F; `Extension/MemberOf` and determinism).


### C.3.1:7 - Interactions (informative)

* **With USM (A.2.6).** Guards that quantify over a kind use **two** predicates: “Scope covers TargetSlice” (USM) **and** whatever **membership** predicate is defined for the kind (see **C.3.2**). Kinds themselves carry **no Scope**.
* **With F–G–R (C.2.2).** This pattern does not alter the triple; typed checks happen **before** scope algebra, preventing invalid compositions.
* **Order of checks reference.** See **Annex C.3.A §5 (E‑01)** for the normative evaluation order: typed compatibility first, then Scope coverage, then penalties to **R** and freshness.
* **With Formality (C.2.3).** A **KindSignature** (C.3.2) declares its **F**; claims retain their own F via weakest‑link.
* **With Bridges (Part B).** Use **KindBridge** (C.3.3) for describedEntity; use **Scope Bridge** (Part B) for applicability. Penalties land in **R** via different channels.


### C.3.1:8 - Authoring & Review (informative)

**When to mint a kind.**
Mint a `U.Kind` when claims repeatedly quantify over “the same sort of thing” and you need: (i) safe composition, (ii) clear Cross‑context mapping, (iii) a place to collect invariants (in **C.3.2**).

**Don’t over‑mint.**
If a local constraint is temporary or purely procedural, prefer a **RoleMask** (C.3.4) over a new subkind.

**Review prompts.**

1. Does the draft introduce a new *describedEntity* concept? → consider a kind.
2. Does prose hint at “is‑a” relationships? → capture as `⊑`, not as scope widening.
3. Are authors trying to widen scope by abstracting wording? → stop; widen **G** only via **ΔG** (USM) with support.


### C.3.1:9 - Examples (informative, technology‑neutral)

1. **Vehicle/PassengerCar.**
   Mint `Kind Vehicle`. Later add `PassengerCar ⊑ Vehicle`. Claims about **Vehicle** may be reused by narrowing to **PassengerCar** without touching **G**. Scope remains an independent predicate over `U.ContextSlice`.

2. **Request/AuthenticatedRequest.**
   If multiple policies speak about “authenticated requests,” declare `AuthenticatedRequest ⊑ Request`. Do **not** widen G to compensate for missing authentication; either change the producer’s kind or insert an adapter (C.3.2/C.3.4) while keeping G honest.


### C.3.1:10 - Conformance checklist (normative)

| ID            | Requirement                                                                                             |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **C3.1‑K‑01** | `U.SubkindOf (⊑)` is a **partial order** (reflexive, transitive, antisymmetric).                        |
| **C3.1‑K‑02** | `U.Kind` **does not carry Scope**. Scope remains on claims/capabilities per **A.2.6**.                  |
| **C3.1‑K‑03** | Kinds are **context‑local**; Cross‑context mapping uses **KindBridge** (C.3.3), not Scope bridges.            |
| **C3.1‑K‑04** | Kinds have **stable ids**; synonyms redirect; Contexts catalog `⊑` links.                                  |
| **C3.1‑K‑05** | **No intent/membership** in this core; refer to **C.3.2** for `KindSignature` and `Extension/MemberOf`. |


### C.3.1:11 - Rationale (informative)

**Why a tiny core?**
Contexts differ wildly in “type” practice. A large, prescriptive core would either (a) force one Tradition’s semantics on all, or (b) become an empty label. The **smallest powerful** core—identity + ordering—gives managers and integrators what they need (safe composition, predictable edits) and leaves intent/membership/bridges/masks to focused sub‑patterns.

**Why “no Scope on kinds”?**
**Scope** (USM) answers “**where** a claim/capability holds” over `U.ContextSlice`. Kinds answer “**what** the claim ranges over.” Blending them recreates the failure mode we are removing (“higher abstraction ⇒ wider scope”). The right split is:

* **Kind**: intensional name + order (`⊑`) *(this pattern)*; intent & membership *(C.3.2)*.
* **Scope**: set of context slices *(A.2.6)*.
* **Assurance**: evidence & penalties *(C.2.2 / Part B)*.
