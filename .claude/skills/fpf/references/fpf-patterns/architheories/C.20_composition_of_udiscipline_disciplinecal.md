## C.20 - Composition of `U.Discipline` (Discipline‑CAL)

**Builds on.** **C.2 KD‑CAL** (F–G–R & CL routing), **A.19/G.0 CG‑Spec** (comparability), **F.9 Bridges** (cross‑Context alignment), **E.10 LEX** (registers & twin labels). **Coordinates with.** **C.21** (Discipline‑CHR, field health), **C.23** (Method‑SoS‑LOG), **F.17–F.18** (UTS). 

### C.20:1 - Problem Frame
Disciplines persist as *knowledge canons* (epistemes), *codified practices & standards*, and *institutional carriers* (journals, bodies, curricula). FPF needs a typed, provenance‑preserving way to **compose** these into a reusable **holon of talk** that travels across contexts *lawfully*. Composition must honour KD‑CAL lanes and the CG‑Spec Standard so that any numeric comparison or aggregation remains auditable and legal.

### C.20:2 - Problem
Without a **composition calculus** for disciplines:
* fields degenerate into labels; editions and rival **Traditions/Lineages** blur;  
* cross‑Context reuse silently drops meaning (no Bridge/CL), or performs illegal aggregations (means on ordinals; unit mixing);  
* selectors (Part G) cannot lawfully gate methods because maturity/evidence are not tied to a field’s canon and carriers.

### C.20:3 - Forces
| Force | Tension |
|---|---|
| **Pluralism vs Cohesion** | Rival traditions must co‑exist ↔ a discipline holon must present a coherent public surface. |
| **Locality vs Federation** | Meaning is context‑local (rooms) ↔ reuse needs Bridges with CL and recorded loss notes. |
| **Rigor vs Agility** | CG‑Spec legality, KD‑CAL lanes ↔ practical authoring and edition flow (UTS/DRR). |
| **Didactic surface vs Assurance depth** | Human‑readable Discipline Card ↔ auditable F–G–R & provenance. |

### C.20:4 - Solution — the **Discipline holon** and Γ_disc

#### C.20:4.1 - U.Types (minting & registers)
* **`U.Discipline`** — a **Holon** that composes an **EpistemeCanon**, **Standards/Practices**, and **Organisational Carriers** into a durable **unit of talk** (R‑core name; twin labels).  
* **`U.AppliedDiscipline`**, **`U.Transdiscipline`** — subtypes of `U.Discipline`.  (**Kernel U‑types; LEX‑governed**).
* **`U.Tradition`**, **`U.Lineage`** — auxiliary holons that organise variants/editions within a `U.Discipline`.  

**Placement/LEX.** `U.Discipline` and its subtypes are **Kernel U‑types** introduced under the **Open‑Ended Kernel** & **Ontological Parsimony** guards (**A.5**, **A.11**) and registered per **E.10/F.17**. This CAL **uses** them, it does not redefine them. If not yet present in A‑cluster, mark as **“provisionally minted”** and open a DRR to finalize placement (E.10 V‑ladder). 

All are **UTS‑published** with **twin labels**; minting follows **E.10** registers/prefix policy and **A.11** parsimony.

#### C.20:4.2 - What a `U.Discipline` is / is not
* A `U.Discipline` is **not** a `U.BoundedContext` and **not** a **Domain**. **Domain** remains a *catalog label* (stitched to D.CTX + UTS): **Discipline ≠ Domain** is enforceable via **E.10 LexicalCheck**; any cross‑Domain/Context reuse **MUST** cite a **Bridge (F.9) + CL + loss notes**; penalties to **R** only; **F/G invariant** (USM/KD‑CAL). 
* **Comparability** of a discipline flows **only through** the discipline’s **CG‑Spec** entries (no ad‑hoc formulas).  
* Cross‑Context/Tradition reuse **MUST** use **Bridge(s)** with **CL** and loss notes; **CL penalties route to R** (KD‑CAL/B.3); **F/G remain invariant**.  
* Public naming surfaces obey **LEX** (I/D/S; twin labels; banned heads); “discipline column” is **didactic only** and **carries no semantics** (enforced by LexicalCheck).

#### C.20:4.3 - Constructor **Γ_disc** (CAL export)
*Signature.*  
`Γ_disc : ⟨EpistemeCanon, StandardsSet, OrgCarriers, {Bridges}, Policy⟩ → U.Discipline`  
*Intent.* Fold the three constituents into a `U.Discipline`, **preserving provenance**, publishing UTS cards, and enabling lawful comparability via referenced **CG‑Spec** rows.  
*Obligations.*  
1) **Provenance & lanes.** Each imported episteme/standard declares **A.10 anchors** and lane tags **{TA, VA, LA}**; freshness windows are recorded.  
2) **Assurance fold.** Use KD‑CAL weakest‑link on R with **Φ(CL)** (and, where applicable, **Φ_plane** for ReferencePlane crossings) **table‑backed and monotone**; publish policy ids. For any justification **path P**, compute **`R_eff(P) = max(0, min_i R_i − Φ(CL_min(P)))`**; for parallel independent lines to the *same* claim take **`R(Γ) = max_P R_eff(P)`**; **`F(Γ)=min`** along used paths. No thresholds inside CHR/CAL (Acceptance‑only). Unknowns propagate as {pass|degrade|abstain} to Acceptance. 
3) **CG‑Spec guard.** Any numeric comparison/aggregation in Discipline reports **MUST** cite the discipline’s **CG‑Spec** with lawful **ScaleComplianceProfile (SCP)**, **Γ‑fold**, and **MinimalEvidence**; units/scale/polarity legality via **MM‑CHR/CSLC** precedes aggregation.  
4) **Scale/Unit/Polarity legality.** Before any comparison/aggregation, **prove legality via MM‑CHR/CSLC** and cite **CG‑Spec characteristic ids** used in the fold (A.17–A.19).
5) **ReferencePlane guard.** When crossings touch `world|concept|episteme`, apply **CL_meta** and route penalties to **R** only; record **plane** on the UTS row.
6) **Edition discipline.** Changes to canons/standards that alter computed ⟨F,G,R⟩ **create a new edition**; DRR captures the rationale; UTS lifecycle records transitions.  
7) **No stealth globalisation.** Cross‑Context mappings are **by Bridge only**; “by‑name reuse” is forbidden** even with similar labels.

#### C.20:4.4 - Discipline ESG (state graph, informative surface)

Export a **Discipline.ESG** with named states and guarded transitions (e.g., *Emerging → Consolidating → Codified → Fragmenting*), where **guards reference C.21 metrics** (CHR‑typed; **Scale/Unit/Polarity + freshness windows**) and cite **CG‑Spec ids**; **all thresholds live only in AcceptanceClauses** (G.4). ESG is **descriptive**; all gating remains in CHR/CAL/LOG packs.

### C.20:5 - Archetypal Grounding *(Tell–Show–Show)*

| Slot | **System** (safety code in a factory) | **Episteme** (discipline canon across editions) |
|---|---|---|
| **Object** | Production line with hazardous operations | “Safety engineering” as *describedEntity target* (accident models, tolerable risk) |
| **Concept** | Acceptance clauses & evaluation templates bound to rigs/windows | Canon texts: causality models, design rules, proofs/benchmarks (e.g., **formal knowledge bases**, **proof artefacts**, **concept schemas**) |
| **Symbol** | Local SOP/notation sets for checklists | Notation packages (CLIF, RDF/TriG, proof scripts) |
| **Γ_disc assembly** | Fold {line‑specific standard, plant procedures, certifying unit} into **`Discipline: Safety‑Plant‑A`** | Fold {canon papers, formal models, journals/committee} into **`Discipline: Safety‑Engineering`** with **Traditions** (e.g., system safety vs resilience engineering) |
| **Evidence lanes** | LA test campaigns (freshness windows), VA design proofs, TA tool quals | VA proofs over kinds, LA replications/meta‑analyses; TA for checkers |

### C.20:6 - Bias‑Annotation
**Lenses:** Governance (naming/UTS), Architecture (CAL+CHR split), Onto/Epist (discipline ≠ domain; triangle fidelity), Pragmatic (authoring/editions), Didactic (twin labels; System/Episteme scenes). **Scope:** context‑local; no “global discipline”.

### C.20:7 - Conformance Checklist (normative)
| ID | Requirement | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **CC‑C20‑1 (CG‑Spec linkage).** | A `U.Discipline` **SHALL** declare the **CG‑Spec** ids and **CHR characteristic ids** behind any comparison/aggregation; thresholds live only in **Acceptance** clauses referenced by those CG‑Specs. | Auditable comparability; no illegal ops. |
| **CC‑C20‑2 (Bridge‑only reuse).** | Any cross‑Context/Tradition use **SHALL** cite **Bridge id + CL + loss notes**; penalties **route to R only**; **F/G invariant**. | Prevent silent globalisation; align with KD‑CAL. |
| **CC‑C20‑3 (ReferencePlane).** For any crossing touching `world|concept|episteme`, **publish plane** and apply **Φ(CL)** (and **Φ_plane**, where applicable) — both **MUST** be **monotone, bounded, table‑backed**; **unknowns** propagate as **{pass|degrade|abstain}** into **Acceptance** with **SCR note**; **no silent `unknown→0`**. |
| **CC‑C20‑4 (Γ_disc integrity).** | `Γ_disc` **MUST** record lane tags and freshness windows for all imported evidence; **Φ(CL)** **MUST** be monotone and table‑backed per policy. | Deterministic assurance; hygiene of penalties. |
| **CC‑C20‑5 (Edition & DRR).** | Discipline editions **SHALL** be recorded via **UTS lifecycle** with DRR links; no silent rewrites or renames. | Traceable evolution. |
| **CC‑C20‑6 (LEX/I‑D‑S).** | `U.Discipline` names **SHALL** follow **LEX** (twin labels; registers; banned heads). **Domain** mentions are catalog‑only. | Register hygiene; avoid “Domain = Discipline”. |
| **CC‑C20‑7 (Crossing visibility hooks).** | Any **cross‑stance / cross‑Context / cross‑plane** reference in Discipline materials **SHALL** publish a **CrossingSurface** for the crossing (**E.18**; Bridge+UTS **A.27**; BridgeCard **F.9**) and expose it via `Expose_CrossingHooks` (**G.10‑3**). Published crossings **MUST** be checkable for **LanePurity** (CL→R only; F/G invariant; Φ tables present) and **Lexical SD** (**E.10**) under the active GateProfile / GateChecks (**A.21**). | Prevents implied crossings; makes provenance auditable & replayable. |
| **CC‑C20‑8 (Discipline column is didactic).** | Any use of a “discipline column” in tables is **didactic only**; semantics are carried by **UTS rows + Bridges**; **Domain** remains a catalog stitch (**E.10/F.17**). |  |
| **CC‑C20‑9 (Lexical firewall).** | Normative sections remain **notation/tool‑neutral**; vendor/tool tokens are avoided (see **E.5.1**). |  |

#### C.20:7.1 - Canonical rewrites (anti‑ambiguity)
* “TDD discipline” → **`Tradition: Test‑Driven`** *(Plain twin keeps “Tradition”)*.  
* “Safety Discipline Owner” → **`Holder#DisciplineStewardRole:Safety‑Context`**.  
* “ClinicalSafetyDomain Governance” → **`DisciplineSpec: Clinical‑Safety`** with comparability in **CG‑Spec**; the **Domain** mention remains a **D.CTX + UTS** catalog stitch.

### C.20:8 - Consequences
**Benefits.** Auditable field composition; lawful federation across traditions; selector‑ready maturity/evidence linkage; didactic surface for stewardship.  
+**Trade‑offs.** Discipline authoring requires CG‑Spec literacy and Bridge hygiene; paid back by safe reuse and clearer governance.

### C.20:9 - Rationale
The calculus keeps **describedEntity local**, **comparability lawful**, and **assurance explicit**. It aligns with KD‑CAL’s weak‑link folds and CL routing, with CG‑Spec’s **ScaleComplianceProfile (SCP)** and **Γ‑fold** rules, and with LEX twin‑label governance. It avoids “phlogiston disciplines” by tying fields to measurable CHRs (C.21) and evidence lanes.

### C.20:10 - Relations
**Builds on.** KD‑CAL (C.2); CG‑Spec (A.19/G.0); Bridges (F.9); LEX (E.10).  
**Coordinates with.** C.21 (field‑health CHRs), C.22 (Problem‑CHR), C.23 (Method‑SoS‑LOG).  
**Constrains.** G.2 **MUST** publish **TraditionCards**/**BridgeMatrix** sufficient for `Γ_disc` to assemble **≥2 Traditions** and **≥3 `U.BoundedContext`** per SoTA synthesis to avoid monoculture. G.5 selector **SHALL** cite Discipline **CG‑Spec ids** and **EvidenceGraph** rows when admitting families.
