## C.3.5 - KindAT — Intentional Abstraction Facet for Kinds (K0…K3)

> **One‑line summary.** Defines **KindAT** as an **informative facet** attached to `U.Kind` that classifies the **intentional abstraction stance** of a kind—**K0 Instance**, **K1 Behavioral Pattern**, **K2 Formal Kind/Class**, **K3 Up‑to‑Iso**—to **guide ΔF/ΔR planning, bridge expectations, catalog/search, and refactoring**. **KindAT is not a Characteristic**: it has **no algebra**, **no thresholds**, and **MUST NOT** appear in guards or composition math. All assurance remains in **F–G–R**; typed semantics remain in **C.3.1–C.3.4**.

**Status.** Mixed:
— **Informative** for the anchors, heuristics, examples, and guidance.
— **Normative** for the **usage rules** that forbid employing AT in guards/composition and constrain its placement.

**Placement.** Part C (Kinds), identifier **C.3.5**. Audience: engineering managers, architects, editors, assurance leads.

**Depends on.**
— **C.3.1** (`U.Kind`, `U.SubkindOf (⊑)`), **C.3.2** (`KindSignature` + F, `Extension/MemberOf`), **C.3.3** (KindBridge + `CL^k`), **C.3.4** (RoleMask).
— **A.2.6 USM** (Claim/Work scope over `U.ContextSlice`), **C.2.2 F–G–R**, **C.2.3 U.Formality (F)**.
— **MM‑CHR** distinction **Facet vs Characteristic** (editors).

**Non‑goals.**
— No numerical scale, no gating, no composition operators, no “quality” scoring.
— No effect on **F**, **G**, or **R** besides **planning hints**.

### C.3.5:1 - Purpose (manager’s view)

Teams constantly decide **how far to formalize** and **how broadly to validate**:

* *Are we speaking about **this cohort** (instances), about **things that behave like X** (pattern), about a **formal class** with invariants, or about objects **up to isomorphism**?*
* *Given that stance, should we invest in **F4 predicates**, **F7 proofs**, or **R** across variants?*
* *What kind of **KindBridge** is realistic (coarse mapping vs up‑to‑iso), and what **`CL^k`** should we expect?*

**KindAT** answers these with a **small, shared vocabulary (K0…K3)** that is **safe to use** (cannot distort F/G/R) yet **actionable** for planning and catalog/search.


### C.3.5:2 - Context & Rationale

#### C.3.5:2.1 - The orthogonality we preserve

* **G (Claim scope)** is **where** a claim holds (A.2.6).
* **Kinds** give **what** a claim is about (C.3.1/3.2).
* **R** is assurance (evidence, freshness, penalties).
* **F** is expression rigor (C.2.3).

Teams often **conflate abstraction with applicability** (“sounds general ⇒ applies broadly”) or **over‑engineer proofs** where **slice‑checks** suffice. AT separates these concerns.

#### C.3.5:2.2 - Why a facet, not a Characteristic

Per **MM‑CHR**, **Characteristics** (e.g., F, G) carry algebra and appear in guards/composition. **KindAT** is only a **tag** on `U.Kind`:

* **No algebra, no thresholds**, not used in guards.
* **Editorial placement** only: on kinds, not on claims.
* **Planning signal**: what ΔF and ΔR typically pay off; what bridge style to expect.

This keeps AT **useful** without risking a “second G” or back‑door quality scores.

#### C.3.5:2.3 - Design choice recap (moved from C.3 §15.2)

* Making AT a Characteristic would **duplicate** G’s role and encourage gating.
* As a **facet**, AT remains a **catalog/navigation and planning device**, not an assurance dimension.


### C.3.5:3 - **Anchors K0…K3** (informative)

> **How to read.** Each anchor states the **intentional stance** of the kind, **inclusion cues**, **non‑examples** (to prevent misuse), and **planning hints** (ΔF/ΔR/bridge expectations). Anchors are **context‑local editorial tags** on `U.Kind`.

#### C.3.5:3.1 - **K0 — Instance‑level**

**Intent.** The kind denotes **exemplars** or a **tightly curated set**; often a named cohort or a concrete template.
**Cues.** Membership relies on listing or direct identity features; little to no general invariants.
**Non‑examples.** Any kind with stable, general invariants belongs in **K2**.
**Planning hints.** Focus **R on TargetSlice** (executable checks, F5/6); avoid premature proof engineering. Bridges are **instance‑maps**; expect **low `CL^k`** outside the Context.

#### C.3.5:3.2 - **K1 — Behavioral Pattern**

**Intent.** The kind is a **role/behavioral** pattern (“things that act like …”), typically stated via Standards or controlled NL, not a full type.
**Cues.** “Duck‑typing” flavor; Standards reference behavior/state transitions.
**Non‑examples.** If you can state global invariants as predicates, consider **K2**.
**Planning hints.** Invest in **F3→F4** (predicate‑like acceptances); **R** must test **behavioral diversity**; bridges are **pattern maps** with moderate `CL^k`.

#### C.3.5:3.3 - **K2 — Formal Kind/Class**

**Intent.** A **formal class** with explicit **invariants/relations** (ontology class, type with Standards).
**Cues.** Predicate‑like signature, subkind lattice, invariants reviewed.
**Non‑examples.** Pure examples/cohorts (K0); informal roles (K1).
**Planning hints.** Raise **KindSignature F** to **F4+**, consider **F7** for safety‑critical cores; **R** should cover **subkinds/variants**; bridges are **type‑maps**, `CL^k` often medium/high.

#### C.3.5:3.4 - **K3 — Up‑to‑Iso**

**Intent.** Defined **up to isomorphism/equivalence** (category‑theoretic flavor; “equal as structure,” not by identity); equality‑as‑structure matters.
**Cues.** Statements invariant under isomorphism; reasoning by equivalence classes.
**Non‑examples.** Classes where identity matters beyond structure.
**Planning hints.** Expect **up‑to‑iso** bridges; `CL^k` can be high where equivalence is respected. **F7–F9** likely for key properties; **R** focuses on **witnesses of equivalence** at interfaces.

| ------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| **ΔF investment**   | Prefer F5/6 executable semantics | F3→F4 acceptance predicates | F4→F7 (predicates/proofs)                  | F7→F9 (proof‑carrying, higher equality) |

### C.3.5:5 - Misuse & Antidotes (informative)

* **“Higher AT ⇒ wider G.”** *Wrong.* **G** changes only via **ΔG** (USM). AT does not alter scope.
* **“Gate on AT.”** *Wrong.* Use **F** thresholds and scope/evidence guards; AT is never a gate.
* **“Depth in `⊑` ⇒ AT.”** *Wrong.* AT is about **intentional stance**, not graph depth.
* **“AT on claims.”** *Wrong.* AT tags **`U.Kind` only**.
* **“AT as quality score.”** *Wrong.* Use **F** and **R** for rigor/reliability.


### C.3.5:6 - **Usage Rules (normative)**

> These are the **only** normative constraints in this pattern. Everything else is guidance.

**AT‑01 (Facet, not Characteristic).** KindAT **SHALL** be treated as a **Facet** per MM‑CHR: it has **no algebra, no thresholds**, and **MUST NOT** appear in guards or composition math.

**AT‑02 (Placement).** If recorded, KindAT **SHALL** be attached to **`U.Kind`** (or its catalog card). It **MUST NOT** be attached to claims/capabilities or used as a proxy for **G**/**F**/**R**.

**AT‑03 (Editorial discipline).** Editors **SHALL NOT** write text implying “higher AT widens scope” or “higher AT increases rigor/reliability.” Any such text **MUST** be revised to reference **ΔG**/**F**/**R** explicitly.

**AT‑04 (Bridge neutrality).** **KindBridge** records **MUST NOT** compute or adjust AT; they may include *informative* remarks about likely anchor alignment. `CL^k` is independent of AT and is assessed from signature/order preservation.

**AT‑05 (Catalog).** Contexts that use AT **SHOULD** record it in **Kind catalog entries** alongside: signature snippet & **F**, subkinds, RoleMasks, KindBridges. Absence of AT implies **“not set”**, not K0.


### C.3.5:7 - Authoring & Review Guidance (informative)

#### C.3.5:7.1 - How to tag (fast rubric)

* If the card lists **concrete items/cohorts**, tag **K0**.
* If the card defines **behavioral obligations** in prose/templates but few global invariants, tag **K1**.
* If the card states **predicates/invariants** and participates in a **subkind lattice**, tag **K2**.
* If the card explicitly reasons **up to isomorphism**, tag **K3**.

#### C.3.5:7.2 - Review checklist (5 minutes)

1. Is the **carrier** a **`U.Kind`** (not a claim)?
2. Does the **tag** match the **signature** (intent)?
3. Are **ΔF**/**ΔR** implications noted for planning (not gating)?
4. Any **RoleMasks** that should be promoted to subkinds (K2 hygiene)?
5. Any **Cross‑context reuse** that suggests **bridge style** (pattern/type/iso)?


### C.3.5:8 - Integration Notes (informative)

* **With C.3.1/3.2 (Kinds, Signature, Extension).** AT guides *how* to evolve signature **F** and *what* R coverage is sensible; it **does not** change membership semantics.
* **With C.3.3 (KindBridge).** AT hints at likely **bridge style** (instance‑map / pattern‑map / type‑map / up‑to‑iso), but **`CL^k`** is still computed from signature/order preservation; penalties route to **R**.
* **With C.3.4 (RoleMask).** Persistent K1‑style masks often warrant **promotion to K2 subkinds**.
* **With A.2.6 (USM).** All scope decisions remain under **G**. AT text should never be used to infer coverage.
* **With C.2.3 (F).** AT does not raise/lower **F**; it **suggests** where raising F is cost‑effective.


### C.3.5:9 - Worked Mini‑Examples (informative)

* **K0 (Instance).** `Account_US_GAAP_2025_Q1_Cohort`. Plan **R** slice checks; avoid type‑maps across Contexts.
* **K1 (Behavior).** `CacheableRequest` (“idempotent under retry; cache key well‑formed”). Raise **F3→F4**; design **R** for failure‑mode diversity; expect **pattern bridges**.
* **K2 (Formal).** `Account` with invariants (balance = debits−credits; posting rules). Raise **F4+**; plan **R** over `Asset`/`Liability` subkinds; bridge via **type maps**.
* **K3 (Up‑to‑Iso).** `UndirectedGraph` up to node relabeling. Expect **up‑to‑iso bridges**; proofs at **F7+**; **R** checks interface equivalence witnesses.


### C.3.5:10 - Conformance Checklist (normative)

| ID        | Requirement                                                                                                   |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AT‑01** | KindAT is treated as **Facet** (no algebra/thresholds); **MUST NOT** appear in guards/composition.            |
| **AT‑02** | AT **MUST** be attached to **`U.Kind`** only (if used); not to claims/capabilities.                           |
| **AT‑03** | Editorial text **MUST NOT** imply AT alters **F/G/R**; revise to name **ΔF/ΔG/ΔR** instead.                   |
| **AT‑04** | KindBridge **MUST NOT** compute/alter AT; `CL^k` is assessed independently.                                   |
| **AT‑05** | If a Context catalogs AT, it **SHOULD** include it in Kind cards with signature **F**, subkinds, masks, bridges. |
