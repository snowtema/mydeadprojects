## C.22 - Problem Typing & TaskSignature Assignment (Problem-CHR)

**Purpose.** Give FPF a **lawful, minimal, and portable** way to speak about “the problem we face” so that the **selector** (G.5) can legally admit/abstain without prose or guesswork. We do this by (i) **typing problems** with CHR‑grounded traits and (ii) **binding** them to a **TaskSignature (S2)** that downstream patterns can consume. The Standard is **Context‑local**, evidence‑anchored, tri‑state‑aware, and bridge‑savvy. TaskSignature is *minimal* but sufficient for **eligibility**, **acceptance**, and **policy‑governed** choice. 

**Status & placement.** Part C (Kernel Extentions Specifications) → Cluster C.I (Core CHRs/CALs).
**Depends on:** **C.16 MM‑CHR** (measurement legality), **G.5** (selector S2/S3), **G.0** (CG‑Spec invariants).
**Coordinates with:** **G.4** (Acceptance/Evidence profiles), **C.23** (MethodFamily admissibility & maturity), **C.18 NQD‑CAL** (QD/illumination), **C.19 E/E‑LOG** (emitters/policies), **E.10** (LEX).

### C.22:1 - Intent

Operationalise No‑Free‑Lunch discipline in selection by ensuring every run‑time decision sees a **typed TaskSignature (S2)**, not a paragraph, and that **“problem”** (method unknown) is cleanly separated from **“task”** (method known; signature bound). The signature is the **smallest CHR‑typed set** sufficient to drive **Eligibility → Acceptance → policy‑governed selection** without illegal arithmetic or silent coercions; crossings are auditable (Bridge+CL → **R_eff only**).
### C.22:2 - Problem Frame (design/run split; crossing-visible)

**method‑first stance**
In FPF a **Problem** exists when a Holder or external **Transformer** cannot cite a known **Method** (or specialisation thereof) that satisfies the current **TaskSignature** under the declared **ScopeSlice(G)**. Problem‑solving therefore entails **strategizing** (selecting or synthesising a method). The resulting **strategy/policy** is a composition under **G.5/E/E‑LOG** and **is not** a new kernel type.  
**Unknown‑first discipline.** Author S2 with `unknown` traits rather than coercions; **SoS‑LOG** branches MUST specify `{admit|degrade|abstain|sandbox}` handling for `unknown` via closed enums registered at UTS.
Un-typed “problems” collapse into **informal prose**; selectors cannot **filter/abstain** lawfully; thresholds leak into scoring; cross-Context reuse is by name, not Bridge. We need a Context-local descriptor that (i) obeys **MM-CHR legality** (Scale/Unit/Polarity proven before any aggregation), (ii) records **Assurance lanes (TA/VA/LA)** per **A.10** and **ReferencePlane**, (iii) carries **tri-state unknowns** explicitly, and (iv) **publishes crossing attestations** (**BridgeCard + UTS row**) with **Φ(CL)/Φ_plane** policy-ids.
Un‑typed “problems” collapse into **informal prose**; selectors cannot **filter/abstain** lawfully; thresholds leak into scoring; cross‑Context reuse is by name, not Bridge. We need a Context‑local descriptor that (i) obeys **MM‑CHR legality** (Scale/Unit/Polarity proven before any aggregation), (ii) records **

### C.22:3 - Problem

Without typed descriptors, **Eligibility/Acceptance** degenerate into prose; **illegal ops** creep in (ordinal means; unit mixing); **cross‑plane comparisons** lose **CL/Φ** routing (**penalties to R_eff only**). 

### C.22:4 - Forces

| Force                        | Tension                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Parsimony vs sufficiency** | Fewer fields to avoid ceremony **vs** enough to drive lawful gating.                                                              |
| **Unknowns**                 | Many traits are **unknown** at intake → tri‑state semantics must propagate to Acceptance without silent coercions.                |
| **CHR legality**             | **No mean on ordinals; no unit mixing**; polarity & scale type must be declared *before* aggregation.                             |
| **Locality vs portability**  | Problem is **in‑room**; still must cross **via Bridges**, with **CL** and (if planes differ) **CL^plane** penalties → **R** only. |


### C.22:5 - Solution — **Problem‑CHR** (fields) + **TaskSignature (S2) binding** *(normative)*

#### C.22:5.1 - Minimal CHR fields (tri‑state aware).
Each field is **CHR‑typed** (Characteristic/Scale/Unit/Polarity; MM‑CHR discipline). Every predicate admits `unknown` (tri‑state). Unknowns must propagate to {degrade|abstain|sandbox} per Acceptance/EvidenceProfile policy (recorded in SCR). (G.4/G.6 alignment)

* **`DataShape`** — data regime & admissible transforms (e.g., tabular, sequence, graph; density; stationarity claims).
* **`NoiseModel`** — uncertainty class / robustness envelope (e.g., iid Gaussian; heavy‑tailed; adversarial budget).
* **`ObjectiveProfile`** — objective heads (**Scale/Unit/Polarity** and **ReferencePlane** declared), polarity, and **lawful orders** (lexicographic, Pareto, medoid/median where legal). **Weighted sums across mixed scale types are forbidden**; ordinal heads use order‑only guards. For QD tasks, explicitly enumerate **Q (quality)**, **D (diversity)**, and **QD‑score** heads; see **DominanceRegime** below.
* `RegularityTraits` — method‑relevant structure (**convexity/differentiability/separability/monotonicity**) as CHR‑typed predicates with guard‑macros (e.g., `ORD_COMPARE_ONLY`, `UNIT_CHECK`, `POLARITY_CHECK`). Include `ConditionClass` (e.g., stiffness/κ‑proxies) where applicable.
* **`Constraints`** — explicit hard/soft constraint classes (feasibility predicates; **ResourceEnvelope**/**RiskEnvelope**). **Thresholds live in Acceptance (G.4) only; never inside CHR or code paths.**
* **`ShiftClass/Stationarity`** — CHR‑typed claims about regime stability (iid | covariate‑shift | concept‑drift | adversarial). Default=`unknown`. Acceptance/Flows MUST honor this in gating or abstain.
* `EvidenceGraphRef (A.10)` — carriers & **lane tags (TA/VA/LA)** with **freshness windows**; **no self‑evidence**; default Γ‑fold = **weakest‑link** unless CAL proves an alternative.
* `ScopeSlice(G)` — **USM** slice of **describedEntity/scope** to bound claims (discipline governance in **CG‑Spec**; Domain is a catalog mark only).
* `Size/Scale` — size/condition proxies (**n, m, κ, sparsity**) with **declared units**; unit mismatch ⇒ {sandbox|refuse}.
* **`Freshness`** — validity window for descriptors.
* `Missingness` — **MCAR/MAR/MNAR** (or mapped equivalents) per **CHR.Missingness**; MUST be honoured by Acceptance/Flows.
* `KindSet` — **`U.Kind[]`** of objects‑of‑talk addressed by the TaskKind; separates **describedEntity (Kind)** from **Scope (USM)**.

**QD / Illumination extensions (normative; ties to C.18/C.19).**
* **`CharacteristicSpaceRef`** — reference to **`U.CharacteristicSpace`**, with declared **d≥2**; **characteristics are CHR‑typed**; **ReferencePlane** per characteristic; pin edition via **`CharacteristicSpaceRef.edition`**.
* **`ArchiveConfig`** — archive **topology** (grid/CVT/graph), **resolution** (bins/centroids), **K‑capacity**, **`InsertionPolicyRef`** (elite replacement/dedup/novelty), and **`DistanceDefRef.edition`** (declare **metric/pseudometric** status and invariances; any normalisation **MUST** cite lawful scale transforms in **CG‑Spec**); legality follows CG‑Spec.
* **`EmitterPolicyRef`** — pointer to emitter/governor policy (C.19) applicable to this TaskSignature; **edition id** recorded.
* **`DominanceRegime`** — `{ParetoOnly | ParetoPlusIllumination}`. **Default = `ParetoOnly`** (illumination remains report‑only telemetry unless CAL explicitly authorises `ParetoPlusIllumination`, policy‑id cited).
* **`IlluminationSummary`** — a **telemetry summary over `Diversity_P`**; **published** by default; excluded from dominance unless a CAL enables `ParetoPlusIllumination` (policy‑id cited).
* **`IlluminationMap`** *(parity‑run)* — required **publication artefact** (grid/CVT/graph per `ArchiveConfig`) recording coverage per niche/cell with `DescriptorMapRef`/`DistanceDefRef.edition`. **Leaderboards as single‑score lists are forbidden**; comparisons **MUST** be under CG‑frames.
* **`PortfolioMode`** — `{Pareto | Archive}`. **Default = `Archive`**: selectors **publish portfolios** (QD archives) rather than a single “best” set; ε‑fronts remain admissible for local decisions under CG‑Spec.
* **`Budgeting`** — evaluation/time/batch **budgets**, including **E/E‑LOG exploration budget** id; units declared (CG‑Spec).
* **`TelemetryHooks`** — **PathSliceId**, **decay/refresh policy ids**, and **edition counters** to record **U.DescriptorMap** and **policy‑id** updates upon illumination gains.
* **`GeneratorIntent`** (OEE) — optional intent to invoke a **`GeneratorFamily`** (G.5) with pointers to **`EnvironmentValidityRegion`**, **`TransferRulesRef`**, and **coverage/regret** reporting expectations.

**Legality.** Before any numeric comparison/aggregation, **prove CSLC legality** (Scale/Unit/Polarity) and **cite CG‑Spec.Characteristics**; publish **ReferencePlane**. **Unknowns** propagate as {degrade|abstain|sandbox}; **no `unknown→0/false` coercions**.

#### C.22:5.2 - TaskSignature (S2) — binding definition (design‑time + run‑time).
A TaskSignature is a minimal typed record the selector consumes:
`⟨Context, TaskKind, KindSet:U.Kind[], DataShape, NoiseModel, ObjectiveProfile, Constraints{incl. Resource/Risk Envelopes}, ScopeSlice(G), EvidenceGraphRef, Size/Scale, Freshness, Missingness, ShiftClass?, BehaviorSpaceRef?, ArchiveConfig?, EmitterPolicyRef?, DominanceRegime?, PortfolioMode?, Budgeting?, TelemetryHooks?, GeneratorIntent?⟩`


**Minimality rule.** S2 carries only fields required for **Eligibility→Acceptance→lawful selection**; any additional traits derived at design‑time are published as provenance (UTS) but **do not expand S2**. 

Values are **CHR‑typed** with **provenance**; traits may be **inferred** from CHR/CAL bindings (e.g., *convexity known? differentiable? ordinal vs interval scales?*) and from **USM** scope metadata. Unknowns are tri‑state; **Missingness semantics MUST align with CHR.Missingness** and be honored by Acceptance/Flows. 

**Design/Run hygiene.** Do not mix DesignRunTag in one signature; **publish GateCrossings** as **CrossingSurface** bundles (**E.18**; Bridge+UTS **A.27**; BridgeCard **F.9**) when importing design‑time traits into run‑time.

#### C.22:5.3 - Provenance & planes.
Record **Context**, **ReferencePlane** for each value; on any cross‑Context/plane reuse, attach BridgeDescription + UTS row, apply **CL** (and, if planes differ, **CL^plane**) penalties to **R_eff only**; both **Φ(CL)** and (if used) **Φ_plane** MUST be **monotone, bounded, and table‑backed**; **no “distance” language; penalties never mutate F/G.** Publish policy‑ids in SCR and cite Bridge ids on crossings.

#### C.22:5.4 - Binding & use.

* **Eligibility** gates read TaskSignature against each **MethodFamily.Eligibility** (C.23) and **CG‑Spec.MinimalEvidence** for referenced characteristics.
* **Acceptance** clauses (G.4) use these fields for **threshold predicates** (thresholds live in Acceptance only).
* **Selection kernel** (G.5.S3) applies a **lawful order** (often partial); **weighted sums across mixed scale types are forbidden**. If only a partial order remains, **return a Pareto (non‑dominated) set** with tie notes. If `PortfolioMode=Archive`, the selector **may** return a **QD archive** (per `ArchiveConfig`) **in addition to** or **instead of** a Pareto set. **Illumination** enters dominance **only** if `DominanceRegime=ParetoPlusIllumination` is **enabled by CAL** (policy id cited); otherwise, QD metrics are **reported** but **excluded** from dominance.
* When `GeneratorIntent` is present, G.5 may dispatch to a registered **`GeneratorFamily`** (POET‑class); the selection surface becomes **pairs** `{environment, method}`, with Environment guarded by **`EnvironmentValidityRegion`** and **`TransferRulesRef`** (C.23 wiring). Report **`IlluminationSummary`** as a **telemetry summary over `Diversity_P`** (report‑only by default) in telemetry; dominance remains unaffected unless policy changes as above.

#### C.22:5.5 - Unknowns.
Every field supports `unknown`; downstream **degrade/abstain/sandbox** behavior is explicit per Acceptance/EvidenceProfile; no implicit coercions. 

#### C.22:5.6 - Publication.
Emit a **ProblemProfile** (…Description) that carries the bound TaskSignature, **UTS** Name Cards for any minted values (twin labels), and SCR‑visible provenance (A.10 anchors, lane tags, freshness, **ReferencePlane**). **Mark any vendor/tool examples as Plain‑register only (LEX V‑4); they are non‑normative.**

#### C.22:5.7 - Open‑Ended tasks (GeneratorFamily) *(normative)*.
If the problem requires **open‑ended generation** of tasks/environments, S2 **SHALL** include `GeneratorIntent` with pointers to **`EnvironmentValidityRegion`** (lawful support of generated environments), **`TransferRulesRef`** (cross‑environment transfer constraints), and **coverage/regret** telemetry expectations. Selector outputs are then portfolios over **{environment, method}**; **coverage/regret** are **telemetry metrics** (reported) and **IlluminationSummary** is a **telemetry summary** (reported), excluded from dominance unless a **CAL** policy promotes them (policy‑id recorded in SCR; see `DominanceRegime`). Edition increments of **CharacteristicSpaceRef.edition**/**DescriptorMapRef.edition**/**DistanceDefRef.edition** and (OEE) **`TransferRulesRef.edition`**, and the **policy‑id** that caused illumination increases **SHALL** be recorded in SCR.


### C.22:6 - Archetypal Grounding (Tell–Show–Show)

*Tell–Show–Show hook (per E.8):* label examples as **Show‑1 (continuous ODE)** and **Show‑2 (MIP)** and cite CHR guard‑macros in‑line so engineers can see **which field drove which gate**.  **Explicitly annotate which S2 fields triggered each Eligibility/Acceptance decision** (e.g., `service_level@ordinal → ORD_COMPARE_ONLY`, `budget@ratio → unit alignment check`).

**A. Differential equations (continuous systems, solver choice).**
*ProblemProfile.* `DataShape=ODE, stiff?=unknown, Size/Scale={n≈10^3}, ObjectiveProfile={↓error@ratio, ↑throughput@ratio}, Constraints={budget≤X, safety_gate@ordinal}, RegularityTraits={Lipschitz known?=unknown, Jacobian sparsity=high}, Missingness=MAR`.
*Binding.* Selector reads TaskSignature; **eligibility** filters MethodFamilies that require known stiffness or differentiability (unknown ⇒ **degrade/abstain** per family); **Acceptance** enforces `safety_gate` as **ordinal predicate**, not averaged (ORD\_COMPARE\_ONLY), and budgets with **unit‑aligned sums** (ratio). The selector returns a **Pareto set**; no cross‑ordinal weighting.

**B. Mixed‑integer optimisation (planning/scheduling).**
*ProblemProfile.* `DataShape=MIP, NoiseModel=deterministic, ObjectiveProfile={↓cost@ratio, ↑service_level@ordinal}, Constraints={SLA hard, workforce soft}, RegularityTraits={convex_relaxation=available}, Size/Scale={vars~10^5}, Missingness=MCAR`.
*Binding.* **CG‑Spec** forbids means over **service\_level** (ordinal); **Acceptance** holds thresholds; **Eligibility** checks convex‑relaxation availability; **Selection** applies **lexicographic** guard (assumption‑fit ≻ evidence‑fit ≻ resource), compute **R\_eff** with Γ‑fold, route **CL** to **R** only; if partial order remains, return a **Pareto set**.

> *Contemporary anchors (informative):* modern **Julia** ecosystems illustrate the “**general call outside, specialised implementations inside**” ethos (e.g., DifferentialEquations.jl, JuMP), aligning with C.22→G.5 multi‑method dispatch under NFL.

**C. Quality‑Diversity portfolio (illumination).**
*ProblemProfile.* `DataShape=policy‑search; ObjectiveProfile={↑reward@ratio, ↑coverage@ratio (report‑only)}, DominanceRegime=ParetoOnly, PortfolioMode=Archive, CharacteristicSpaceRef(d=3, characteristics=CHR‑typed), ArchiveConfig(grid, res=32×32×16, K=1, InsertionPolicyRef=elite‑replace, DistanceDefRef.edition=v1), EmitterPolicyRef=v2, Budgeting{eval=1e6}, TelemetryHooks{PathSliceId=…}`.
*Binding.* Selector may return an **archive**; **coverage/illumination** are **reported** but **excluded** from dominance (default). Any change of `DistanceDefRef.edition`/Emitter policy is **editioned** and logged in SCR.

**D. Open‑ended environment generation (POET‑class).**
*ProblemProfile.* `GeneratorIntent{GeneratorFamilyRef=…, EnvironmentValidityRegion=… (CHR‑typed), TransferRulesRef=…, CoverageMetric=…}`, `PortfolioMode=Archive`.
*Binding.* Selector outputs **{environment, method}** pairs that pass Eligibility; **TransferRules** govern cross‑environment policy reuse; telemetry reports **coverage/regret** and **IlluminationSummary** with **edition/policy‑id** when improved.

### C.22:7 - Bias‑Annotation (LEX/discipline guards)

* **No minted “Strategy” head.** “Strategy/policy” are *roles/lenses* inside G.5; do **not** introduce a new `U.Type` “Strategy”.
* **No minted `U.Type` “Strategy”.** Strategy/policy are roles/lenses inside G.5 Compose under E/E‑LOG; keep “strategy” as Plain where pedagogically needed.
* **Transdiscipline vs domain.** Comparability flows through **`U.Discipline` CG‑Spec**; “Domain” is a catalog mark stitched to D.CTX + UTS; do **not** attach norms to Domain labels.
* **Plain twins & head‑anchoring.** Use Description/Spec morphology correctly (I/D/S; E.10.D2). 

### C.22:8 - Anti‑patterns (normative):
* **AP‑1** Pre‑binding a Method into S2 (“problem as if task”); **Remedy:** keep S2 method‑agnostic; bind only lawful traits.
* **AP‑2** Silent `unknown→false/0` in Eligibility/Acceptance.  
* **AP‑3** Cross‑ordinal averaging / ordinal–interval scalar mixes.  
* **AP‑4** **Design/run chimera** signatures (mixing stances).  
* **AP‑5** **Domain** treated as governance (attach governance to **U.Discipline/CG‑Spec**, not Domain).  
* **AP‑6** Implicit handling of data‑shift (assume iid); **Remedy:** declare `ShiftClass` (or `unknown`) and gate via Acceptance.
* **AP‑7** Tool/vendor tokens in normative text; **Remedy:** move to Plain‑register note; keep Tech anchors on CHR/CAL ids (LEX V‑4).
**Remedies:** tri-state predicates; lawful orders (lexi/Pareto/median/medoid); **GateCrossing visibility** via Bridge+UTS+CL/CL^plane (penalties → R only); Domain stitched to **D.CTX + UTS** only.
**Remedies:** tri‑state predicates; lawful orders (lexi/Pareto/median/medoid); explicit **GateCrossing** publication via **CrossingSurface** (BridgeCard + UTS row + `CL/Φ` policy‑ids; **E.18/A.27/F.9**); Domain stitched to **D.CTX + UTS** only.

### C.22:9 - Conformance Checklist (normative)

0. **Minimal S2.** S2 contains only fields necessary for Eligibility/Acceptance/selection; any extra derived traits remain provenance.
1. **TaskSignature present (S2).** All TaskKinds **publish** a TaskSignature with all fields declared and **CHR‑typed**; `unknown` supported for each.
2. **CHR legality proven.** Any numeric comparison/aggregation **cites CG‑Spec** by **Characteristic id** and proves **CSLC legality**; **no mean on ordinals; no unit mixing**.
3. **Unknowns propagate.** Unknowns **must** map to {pass|degrade|abstain} in **Acceptance**/**Eligibility**; no implicit coercions; behavior recorded in **SCR**.
4. **Evidence lanes.** **A.10 anchors** + **Assurance lanes (TA/VA/LA)** + **freshness windows** recorded; **Γ‑fold** default=weakest‑link unless proved otherwise.
5. **ReferencePlane guarded.**  ReferencePlane noted **per value and per ObjectiveProfile head**; on crossings apply **CL** (and **CL^plane** if planes differ); **Φ(CL)/Φ_plane** are **monotone, bounded, table‑backed and documented in the `CG‑Spec`**; penalties → **R_eff only** (F/G invariant).
6. **Acceptance thresholds live in CAL.** No thresholds in CHR or code paths; only in **G.4 AcceptanceClauses**. 
7. **Selector legality.** Selection uses **admissible (possibly partial) orders**; **weighted sums across mixed scale types are forbidden**; return a **Pareto set** when appropriate. 
8. **Crossings published (visibility).** Any cross-stance/cross-Context reuse emits **BridgeCard/BridgeDescription + UTS row** with CL notes and (if planes differ) CL^plane + Φ_plane.
9. **UTS twin labels.** All exported cards publish **Name Cards** with twin labels; Bridges carry loss notes. 
10. **GateCrossing checks.** Published TaskSignature and any referenced crossings satisfy: (i) stance tagging (if used; informative only), (ii) **CrossingSurface** presence/consistency (**E.18**; **A.27**; **F.9**), (iii) **LanePurity** (CL→R only; F/G invariant; Φ tables present), and (iv) **Lexical SD** (**E.10**). Failures are **blocking** under the active GateProfile / GateChecks (**A.21**).
11. **QD fields (when QD is in scope).** If `PortfolioMode=Archive` or QD heads are present, **CharacteristicSpaceRef** (d>=2), **ArchiveConfig** (topology, resolution, K, `InsertionPolicyRef`, `DistanceDefRef.edition`), and **EmitterPolicyRef** **SHALL** be present and CHR-typed; characteristics declare **ReferencePlane**.
12. **DominanceRegime default.** `DominanceRegime` **defaults to `ParetoOnly`**; inclusion of illumination in dominance **MUST** be enabled by a **CAL.Acceptance policy**; the policy id **SHALL** be published in SCR.
13. **Telemetry.** **PathSliceId**, **refresh/decay policies**, and **edition counters** for **CharacteristicSpaceRef**/**DistanceDefRef**/**EmitterPolicyRef** **SHALL** be recorded; any illumination increase **SHALL** log the **policy-id** that triggered it.
14. **GeneratorIntent (when OEE is in scope).** `GeneratorIntent` **SHALL** cite **`EnvironmentValidityRegion`** and **`TransferRulesRef`** (ids resolvable in G.5/C.23); absence => `Abstain` for OEE dispatch.
15. **Budgets.** `Budgeting` (eval/time/batch) **SHALL** declare units and E/E-LOG exploration budget id when used.
16. **Archive legality.** `DistanceDefRef.edition` and any novelty measures **SHALL** be CSLC-lawful and **editioned**; illegal ops => **Abstain**.
17. **Planes.** **ReferencePlane** **SHALL** be declared for all QD heads/axes; plane crossings apply **Phi\_plane** (penalty to **R** only).
18. **Unknowns.** Unknown QD fields **map** to `{degrade|abstain|sandbox}`; no coercions.

### C.22:10 - Interfaces & Data Paths

*Inputs.* `ProblemProfile` (…Description), CG-Spec ids, Evidence Graph Ref (A.10), D.CTX; (if QD) CharacteristicSpaceRef/ArchiveConfig/EmitterPolicyRef configs; (if OEE) GeneratorIntent.
 *Produces.* `TaskSignature@Context` (S2) with provenance; **SCR-visible** fields; UTS Name Cards for any minted traits; (if QD/OEE) archive/portfolio semantics and telemetry hooks declared.
 *Consumed by.* **G.5** (Eligibility/Selection kernel), **G.4** (Acceptance/Evidence), **C.23** (admit/degrade/abstain rules; maturity ladder).

### C.22:11 - Consequences (informative)

* **Lawful selection.** Dispatch is **explainable** and **audit-ready**; every reason in/out cites TaskSignature fields, CG-Spec rows, and Gamma-fold contributors. 
* **Local first, portable later.** Context-local semantics are primary; Bridges make portability **deliberate and costed** (penalties to **R** only). 
* **Frictionless downstream.** G.1-G.5 consume a **single, typed** Standard; thresholds are cleanly separated into **Acceptance**; unknowns are not guessed.
* **QD/OEE-ready.** Typed QD and GeneratorIntent fields make **portfolio** and **open-ended** workflows **first-class**, with lawful dominance, editioned distances, and policy-aware illumination.

### C.22:12 - Relations
**Builds on:** **C.16 MM-CHR**, **G.0 CG-Spec**. **Coordinates with:** **G.4 Acceptance**, **G.5 Selector**, **C.18 NQD-CAL**, **C.19 E/E-LOG**, **C.23 Method-SoS-LOG**. **Constrained by:** **E.10 (LEX/I/D/S)**, **E.18 (GateCrossing visibility / publication gating)**.

### C.22:13 - Author's quick checklist

1. **Write the ProblemProfile.** Context, TaskKind, ObjectKinds, USM **ScopeSlice(G)**, describedEntity (GroundingHolon, ReferencePlane). 
2. **Fill TaskSignature (S2).** Populate all fields; mark `unknown` explicitly; align **Missingness** with CHR semantics. 
3. **Bind CG-Spec ids.** For any numeric comparison/aggregation you expect downstream, cite **CG-Spec.Characteristics** and prove **CSLC** legality. 
4. **Attach Evidence Graph Ref.** Lanes (TA/VA/LA), carriers, freshness windows; set **Gamma-fold** default; no self-evidence. 
+5. **Publish crossings.** If importing across a **GateCrossing** boundary, mint **BridgeDescription + UTS row**; record **CL/CL^plane**; penalties **→ R only**. 
6. **Keep thresholds in Acceptance.** Move any thresholds (gate numbers) into **G.4**;  wire **RSCR** refusal tests (illegal ops; unit/scale checks; **tri-state unknowns**; CL->R routing; **Phi tables present**).
7. **Run GateCrossing checks** on the signature and crossings: stance tagging (if used; informative only), **CrossingSurface** presence/consistency (**E.18/A.27/F.9**), **LanePurity**, and **Lexical SD** (**E.10**); attach **UTS Name Cards** with twin labels.
8. **Bias audit.** Check E.5.4 and C.21 hooks if the problem lives *inside* a discipline dashboard or SoTA pack.


### C.22:14 - Goldilocks hook (design‑time)

When generating candidate solutions for a **TaskKind**, target **“goldilocks”** slots (feasible‑but‑hard) so that the TaskSignature is informative (neither trivial nor impossible); this aligns with **G.1** (target goldilocks, abductive provenance) and ensures the **TaskSignature is informative** (neither trivial nor impossible) for **G.5** selection.

### C.22:End
