## C.13 — Constructional Mereology (Compose‑CAL)

### C.13:1 - Intent

Provide a single, generative calculus for part–whole structure so that **all** structural relations in FPF are *constructed* (not merely declared) from three primitives and thereby inherit extensional identity by design. The calculus is hidden from day‑to‑day users behind relation aliases; its artefacts are traces that witness how a whole arises from its parts.

Also known as *“Γₘ mereology”*, *“constructor‑based composition”*.

**Layer.** *calculus.*
**Depends on.** Kernel only (no upward imports).
**Consumed by.** CT2R‑LOG (B.3.5) Working‑Model alias logic and any FPF pattern that needs part–whole semantics. Compose‑CAL does **not** import alias definitions; it merely emits traces that others may reference.

Compose‑CAL introduces a **single construction operator Γₘ** with exactly three constructors—**sum**, **set**, **slice**—sufficient to build structural wholes, collections‑as‑wholes, and aspects **without** extending the Kernel’s type set. No “parallel” or “temporal slice” constructor is added. Every construction yields a **trace** that serves as the witness for structure. Human‑facing relations such as *ComponentOf*, *MemberOf*, *AspectOf* are defined elsewhere as **Working‑Model aliases** and are *grounded* in these traces; Compose‑CAL itself remains purely generative and extensional.


### C.13:2 - Problem frame & Problem

FPF presents a unified structural backbone used across disciplines. Historically, sub‑relations like *ComponentOf* or *MemberOf* were **declared** directly. This maximised usability but provided no generative guarantee that a new subtype was extensionally well‑behaved or reducible to common mereology.

Declared lists of part‑of sub‑relations **scale poorly** and **lack identity guarantees**. Engineers ask for a *single dial* (“is x part of y?”), while ontologists need a principled foundation that (a) avoids Kernel bloat and (b) proves that wholes are nothing over and above their parts. Adding yet another bespoke relation (e.g., *PortionOf*) should not entail schema surgery or ad‑hoc rules.

### C.13:3 - Forces

* **Parsimony (C‑5).** Add no core types if composition suffices; keep the constructor set minimal.
* **Minimal Kernel (P‑1).** Generativity must live in a calculus pattern, not in Kernel axioms and postulates.
* **Cognitive asymmetry.** Everyday users want “one part‑of query”; specialists accept complexity backstage.
* **Trans‑disciplinary unification.** Every pattern that needs mereology should reuse one *generative* basis.
* **Green‑field strictness.** With no legacy to break, we can require grounding for new structural edges.

### C.13:4 - Solution

#### C.13:4.1 - Solution sketch

**Compose‑CAL SHALL provide Γₘ with three and only three constructors:**
1. **`Γₘ.sum(parts:Set[U.Entity])`** — returns a whole *W* such that each *p* in *parts* stands in **KernelPartOf(p, W)**.
2. **`Γₘ.set(elems:Set[U.Entity])`** — returns a **collection** *C*; each *e* in *elems* stands in a calculus‑internal **mero:KernelPartOf(e, C)** under **member‑as‑part** semantics (publication alias: typically **`ut:MemberOf`**). **Counts/order** (e.g., parallel/serial factors) are **not carried here**; they live in method/time families adjacent to structure.  *Note:* although `mero:KernelPartOf` is transitive in the calculus, the **published** `MemberOf` alias remains **non‑transitive** by design (see A.14 guards). 
3. **`Γₘ.slice(entity:U.Entity, facet:U.Facet)`** — returns an **aspect** *S* such that **mero:KernelPartOf(S, entity)** and *S* carries the declared **facet**. Temporal facets are excluded here.
   
+**Note.** The calculus names an internal backbone **`mero:KernelPartOf`**; the Kernel’s public `ut:PartOf`/**A.14** catalogue remain unchanged. Publish only via Working‑Model aliases (CT2R‑LOG).

+The calculus emits a **trace** for every construction; Structural aliases **MUST** be *grounded by* exactly one such trace.

**Non‑goals (clarifications).**
* No extra constructors for “parallelism” or “time slices”; parallelism is modelled via **set** (with order handled in `Γ_method`), and temporal parts live in the appropriate temporal/system calculus. This preserves parsimony.
* Compose‑CAL does not define user‑visible relation names; those belong to the alias layer.

#### C.13:4.2 - Normative Standard (high‑level)

* **C13‑N1.** *Extensional identity.* Two Γₘ results are identical iff they have the same parts under the same constructor and facet conditions.
* **C13-N2.** *Structural grounding stance.* Every **structural** edge **MUST** reference **exactly one** Γₘ trace as its grounding witness **and SHALL declare `validationMode = axiomatic`** (see B.3.5 / E.14). **Structural edges MUST NOT** be published in `postulate` or `inferential` stances.
* **C13‑N3.** *Algebraic laws.* `Γₘ.sum` and `Γₘ.set` are **commutative** and **idempotent** over their inputs; `Γₘ.slice` composes only by facet‑compatible refinement.
* **C13‑N4.** *Acyclicity & antisymmetry.* Structural part‑of induced by Γₘ is transitive, antisymmetric, and acyclic at the level of entities. *(Formal axioms appear later in this pattern.)*
* **C13‑N5.** *Separation of concerns.* Γₘ provides constructions and traces; naming, aliasing and human‑level relation taxonomies are defined outside Compose‑CAL (see B.3.5 for the CT2R‑LOG handshake).
* **C13‑N6.** *Member vs component.* `Γₘ.set` yields **collections** whose Working‑Model alias is **MemberOf**; authors **SHALL NOT** infer **ComponentOf** from **MemberOf** without a separate `Γₘ.sum` narrative.
* **C13‑N7.** *Domain guard.* Do **not** apply Compose‑CAL to roles, methods, or works (see A.12/A.15): these are outside mereology.

#### C.13:4.3 - Scope, applicability, terms & notation

+Use Compose-CAL whenever a claim concerns **structural containment** of entities (assemblies, collections, aspects). Compose-CAL is *not* used for epistemic relations between knowledge artefacts; those are **epistemic** relations and may be justified by **Logical/Mapping** and/or **Empirical Validation** with an explicit `validationMode ∈ {inferential, postulate}`. Compose-CAL is neutral with respect to domain (mechanical, biological, software, etc.).

* **Γₘ** — the mereological construction operator of this calculus.
* **trace** — a minimal, inspectable witness that a constructor was applied to given inputs to yield a whole (or aspect).
* **structural part‑of** — the structural relation induced by Γₘ; user‑facing aliases (e.g., *ComponentOf*, *MemberOf*) are separate patterns that **must** point back to traces.
  
 **Alias readiness.** Typical CT2R mappings:  
* **ComponentOf** ⇢ `sum` narrative;  
* **MemberOf** ⇢ `set` narrative;  
* **AspectOf** ⇢ `slice` narrative;  
* **PortionOf** ⇢ `slice(entity, facet="material/spatial‑region")` **plus** metrical semantics (A.14);  
* **ConstituentOf** (logical/content) ⇢ `sum` narrative over conceptual parts. *(Material mixtures are **not** `ConstituentOf`; use `PortionOf` or `ComponentOf` per A.14.)*
 
### C.13:5 - Archetypal Grounding *(System / Episteme duo)*

> **Tell–Show–Show.** Compose‑CAL is a thinking‑level calculus for building structural wholes from parts. We *show* it twice—first on a **System** (structural) and then on an **Episteme** case (where constructive grounding is *not* the primary mode).

#### C.13:5.1 - **System** (structural; constructive grounding)

**Story.** A **Skid** is assembled from its **Pump**, **Motor**, **Baseframe**, and **Manifold**.

**Constructive grounding (Γ\_m).**
Narrate a *sum* of parts: “Skid = sum{Pump, Motor, Baseframe, Manifold}.” This uses **`Γ_m.sum`** to obtain a whole whose parts stand in **KernelPartOf**; the resulting Working‑Model relation engineers publish is **`ut:ComponentOf`** on each edge from part to whole. The mapping “*sum → ComponentOf*” reflects the intended aliasing between constructive traces and human‑facing mereology.

**Facets and collections.** 
Need the **inspection surface**? Narrate **`Γₘ.slice(Skid, "spatial")`** and publish **`ut:AspectOf`**. Need a group of **Transfer interactions**? Narrate **`Γₘ.set{…}`** and publish **`ut:MemberOf`**—this is a **collection-as-whole**, not a sub‑assembly; no component identity is implied without a separate **`Γₘ.sum`** narrative.

**Plane separation.**
Assembly **order** and **time** are *not* encoded here: parallel lines and schedules live in method/time families and are described adjacent to, not inside, the part‑tree.

#### C.13:5.2 - **Episteme** (knowledge‑bearing; non‑constructive first)

**Story.** A **Mass‑Flow Representation** is used to stand for a measured flow in a plant dataset.

**Grounding choice.** 
Here the Working‑Model relation (e.g., **RepresentationOf**) is **epistemic**. Authors typically justify it by *inferential* or *postulate* stances (argument or calibration cues), not by a mereological construction; constructive traces remain optional. This preserves the firewall between structure and knowledge claims while keeping a clear path to stronger assurance if the team later reframes part of the representation structurally (e.g., sets of interactions as a **`Γ_m.set`** for a flow bundle).

#### C.13:5.3 - Scope justification

* **Universality.** The trio **sum / set / slice** appears across mechanical assemblies, biological complexes, and organizational artifacts; aliasing to **ComponentOf / MemberOf / AspectOf** provides a stable Working‑Model surface for those domains.
* **Parsimony.** No “parallel” or “temporal slice” constructor is added; time slices belong in the temporal calculus, and parallelism is modelled as a **set** plus method metadata.

| **Collection ↔ Composition swap** | Using **MemberOf** to stand in for **PartOf**, then inferring structural identity.                              | Keep **set** outputs as *collections*; use **sum** for wholes with extensional identity.                                     | A.14 (Advanced Mereology)                   |

### C.13:7 - Conformance Checklist *(normative, calculus‑level)*

The following regulate **how to think and write** when invoking Compose‑CAL. They are notation‑agnostic and conceptual.

| ID                                         | Requirement                                                                                                                                                                                    | Purpose                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CC‑C13‑1 (Three moves only).**           | Authors **SHALL** construct structural narratives using exactly **`Γ_m.sum`**, **`Γ_m.set`**, and **`Γ_m.slice`**. No additional constructors are introduced in this calculus.                 | Preserve **parsimony** and cross‑domain comparability.                  |
| **CC‑C13‑2 (Kernel invariants).**          | Constructive narratives **SHALL** respect **KernelPartOf** invariants (transitivity, antisymmetry, acyclicity) and yield extensional identity for wholes.                                      | Keep structural identity intelligible and replayable.                   |
| **CC‑C13‑3 (Algebraic laws).**        | `sum`/`set` are commutative & idempotent; `slice` composes only with facet‑compatible refinement. | Make traces **peer‑reconstructible** and easy to replay in thought. |
| **CC‑C13‑4 (No order/time in mereology).** | Authors **SHALL NOT** encode execution order, parallelism, or temporal coverage via constructors; such concerns belong to method/time planes and are stated adjacent to structure.             | Maintain the plane firewall.                                            |
| **CC‑C13‑5 (Narratability).**              | Each constructive trace **SHALL** be narratable in plain language **without introducing new primitives**.                                                                                      | Enforce human‑first clarity; uphold C‑5.                                |
| **CC‑C13‑6 (Alias alignment).**            | When Publishing Working‑Model relations for structural content, authors **SHOULD** align “sum→ComponentOf”, “set→MemberOf (or pattern‑specific)”, “slice→AspectOf” in their explanatory prose. | Keep alias semantics stable across Contexts.                               |
| **CC-C13-7 (CT2R-LOG handshake).**     | For every **structural** edge on the Working-Model, authors **SHALL** set `validationMode=axiomatic` and point **`tv:groundedBy`** to exactly **one** Γₘ trace (`sum|set|slice`). *Legacy “Tier-1” wording deprecated; express formality via **F** per C.2.3.* | Clean bridge to the Working-Model alias layer; decouples relation kind from legacy “tiers”. |
| **CC‑C13‑8 (Member ≠ Component).**         | A **set** output remains a *collection*; authors **SHALL NOT** infer **ComponentOf** from **MemberOf**. When an integrated assembly is intended, provide a separate **`Γ_m.sum`** narrative.   | Prevent membership→component conflation.                                 |
| **CC‑C13‑9 (Facet explicitness).**         | **Slice** narratives **SHALL** name the **facet** used; temporal facets are excluded (handled elsewhere).                                                                                      | Keep aspects precise and non‑temporal.                                  |
| **CC‑C13‑10 (No roles in mereology).** | Do not apply Γₘ to `U.Role`, `U.Method`, or `U.Work`; these are outside mereology (A.12/A.15). | Preserve the plane firewall. |
| **CC‑C13‑11 (Member non‑transitive).** | When publishing `MemberOf`, do not rely on transitive closure across collection‑of‑collections; surface semantics remain non‑transitive per A.14. | Prevent Member→Component drift. |

> **Author’s note.** Compose‑CAL is a calculus for **constructive** reasoning about structure. Publishing remains in the **Working‑Model** layer (see B.3.5); constructive narratives are attached when the team seeks stronger assurance, never as a substitute for clear human‑facing relations.

### C.13:8 - Consequences

**Benefits**

 * **Extensional clarity.** Every structural claim is reconstructed from `Γ_m.sum | Γ_m.set | Γ_m.slice`: **sum** establishes component‑assembly identity; **set** establishes collection identity; **slice** yields aspects as parts—without expanding the Kernel.
* **Human–first publication, formal–on‑demand.** Teams keep publishing **Working‑Model** relations (e.g., `ut:ComponentOf`), while **assurance** is attached as needed via a constructive grounding narrative and `tv:groundedBy` (see B.3.5).
* **Separation of planes preserved.** Order/parallelism and temporal coverage remain in `Γ_method` / `Γ_time`; structure is never overloaded to carry them, avoiding recurrent category errors.
* **Uniformity across domains.** The same triad models mechanical assemblies, socio‑technical memberships, and informational wholes without domain‑specific constructors or ad‑hoc exceptions.
* **Didactic economy.** Authors learn one compact calculus; reviewers gain a predictable place to look for constructive justification when `validationMode = axiomatic` (B.3.5 alignment).
* **Compositional reuse.** Traces are reusable fragments of reasoning; complex wholes are narratable as sums of sub‑traces, with sets for concurrency and slices for aspect selection.

**Trade‑offs / Mitigations**

* **Discipline cost at higher assurance.** Writing a concise grounding narrative for axiomatic claims takes effort. *Mitigation:* reuse the micro‑templates in this pattern’s Grounding section and keep narratives notation‑free.
* **Over‑use risk.** Temptation to treat collections as integrated assemblies. *Mitigation:* keep **MemberOf** distinct from **ComponentOf**; both `set` and `sum` yield wholes, but only **`sum`** establishes **component** structure and assembly identity.
* **Temporal leakage risk.** Authors may try to smuggle time into structure via “temporal slices.” *Mitigation:* use `Γ_time` for temporal statements and `slice` only for intensional aspects, not for time windows.

> **One‑line takeaway.** Compose‑CAL gives a minimal, universal *how‑it‑was‑built* story for any structural edge, without disturbing the human‑first publication surface defined in B.3.5.


### C.13:9 - Rationale (informative)

**Why exactly three moves?**
`sum`, `set`, and `slice` are jointly sufficient and minimally overlapping:

* **`sum`** creates an **integrated whole** from parts and thereby establishes **component** structure (assembly identity).
* **`set`** creates a **collection‑as‑whole**; members are **parts of the collection** under member‑as‑part semantics, but **no component integration** is implied.
* **`slice`** returns an **aspect as part** of its bearer (facet‑constrained, e.g., spatial/material); temporal facets are excluded here.

All three moves create new entities; **sum** is the only move that establishes **component** identity. Neither `set` nor `slice` changes the identity of their inputs, and `set` never upgrades membership to component status. Temporal coverage and workflow order are handled in their own planes.

This separation mirrors long‑standing distinctions between composition, collection, and aspect, while enforcing **parsimony**: no additional constructors are introduced into the Kernel (C‑5). The calculus remains **notation‑agnostic**: its meanings are given in prose and mathematics; any diagrams are illustrative only, in line with the Notational‑Independence guard‑rail (E.5).

**Why constructive grounding lives outside the publication surface.**
FPF privileges **Working‑Model** relations as the canonical form for communication and design. Compose‑CAL supplies the **constructive shoulder** of the **Assurance Layer**: when authors choose `validationMode = axiomatic`, they narrate the whole as a `sum` of parts (with optional `set` and `slice` scaffolding) and point to that narrative via `tv:groundedBy`. This keeps the text readable while preserving a path to stronger assurance (B.3 family, Authoring Template).

**Why order/time are out of scope.**
Correctness‑by‑sequence and temporal coverage are orthogonal to **parthood**. Encoding them as parts breeds contradictions (e.g., “phase‑as‑component”). Compose‑CAL deliberately refuses any “serial/parallel/temporal constructor,” delegating such concerns to `Γ_method` and `Γ_time` and aligning with B.1’s flavour separation.


### C.13:10 - Relations

**Builds on**

* **A.14 Advanced Mereology.** Uses its structural catalogue (Component/Portion/Aspect vs Member) as the *target* of constructive narratives; never collapses Member into Part.
* **E.5 Guard‑Rails (Notational Independence).** Meanings are given in prose; diagrams are illustrative only.  
* **E.5 Guard‑Rails (Unidirectional Dependency).** Compose‑CAL depends **downward** only; it never imports alias layers or higher planes.
* **E.8 Authoring Conventions.** Conforms to the canonical pattern template (Grounding section for architectural patterns; CC placement).

**Coordinates with**
* **B.3.5 CT2R‑LOG.** `tv:groundedBy` refers (conceptually) to Compose‑CAL traces when `validationMode = axiomatic`; **Working‑Model** relations remain the publication interface.
* **B.1 flavours.** Keeps order (`Γ_method`) and time (`Γ_time`) outside structure; may co‑appear in narratives when relevant but never as constructors.
* **Kind-CAL / Lang‑CHR.** Provide the Mapping shoulder of assurance (labels, type alignment) that complements constructive narratives in this pattern.
* **KD‑CAL.** Provides the Logical shoulder when authors justify relations inferentially instead of constructively.
* **C.16 (Measurement substrate).** Supplies quantitative hooks when a constructive narrative benefits from explicit counts/ratios (e.g., cardinalities, coverage), while keeping metrics distinct from mereology.

**Constrains**
* Any pattern that **creates** or **reasons about** structural wholes SHOULD narrate them using only `sum | set | slice`.
* Structural publication MUST NOT encode order/time; such claims belong to their dedicated flavours.
* Introducing new structural constructors requires a separate parsimony argument and is discouraged unless the triad cannot narrate the case without ambiguity.

**Provides**
* A minimal generative basis (`Γ_m.sum | Γ_m.set | Γ_m.slice`) and the corresponding reading discipline for constructive narratives.
* A stable interface with CT2R‑LOG for `tv:groundedBy` links under `validationMode = axiomatic`.
