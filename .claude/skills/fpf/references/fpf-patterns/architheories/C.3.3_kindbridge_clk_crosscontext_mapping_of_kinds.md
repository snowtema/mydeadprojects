## C.3.3 - KindBridge & CL^k — Cross‑context Mapping of Kinds

> **One‑line summary.** Defines **`KindBridge`** as the normative mechanism for moving **kinds** (their **intent** and selected **subkind‑of** links) between bounded contexts (“Contexts”). A bridge declares **how a source kind maps to a target kind**, which parts of the **`⊑`** order are preserved or collapsed, and publishes a **type‑congruence level `CL^k`** with **loss notes** and a **definedness area**. **`CL^k` penalties apply only to Reliability (R)** when a claim depends on Cross‑context classification; **F** (formality) and **G** (Claim scope) remain unchanged. Scope translation continues to use the **USM Bridge + CL** channel; **KindBridge** is a **separate, parallel channel** for describedEntity.

**Status.** Normative in **Part C**. Identifier **C.3.3**.
**Audience.** Engineering managers, architects, assurance leads, editors.

**Depends on.**

* **C.3.1 — U.Kind & SubkindOf (Core):** kinds are context‑local intensional objects; `⊑` is a partial order; kinds **do not carry Scope**.
* **C.3.2 — KindSignature (+F) & Extension/MemberOf:** signature declares its own **F**; membership `MemberOf(e,k,slice)` is **deterministic** per `U.ContextSlice`.
* **A.2.6 — USM (Context slices & Scopes):** Claim scope (**G**) and Work scope live on claims/capabilities; scope bridging and **CL** penalties are defined there.
* **C.2.2 — F–G–R:** weakest‑link; penalties land in **R**, not **F/G**.
* **C.2.3 — U.Formality (F):** signature rigor.

**Non‑goals.**
— No repository/notation mandates; conceptual only.
— No Scope mapping here (that’s USM); **KindBridge** maps **kinds**, not scopes.
— No new arithmetic on `CL^k`; it reuses the **ordinal anchor semantics** of CL (Part B) but applies to kinds.

### C.3.3:1 - Purpose & Audience

Cross‑context reuse fails in two **orthogonal** ways:

1. **Applicability** (G): *where* the claim holds (handled by USM Scope Bridge).
2. **describedEntity** (Kind): *what* the claim quantifies over (handled by **KindBridge**).

**C.3.3** gives managers an explicit, auditable channel for **(2)**, so a team can say, with evidence: *“`Vehicle` in Lab maps to `TransportUnit` in Plant with `CL^k=2`; the EV subkind collapses; here’s what we lost.”* Guards stay deterministic; assurance math stays clean (penalties in **R** only).


### C.3.3:2 - Context

Contexts use different **classifications**: ontology classes vs shape Standards, regulatory cohorts vs app types, etc. Informal “same‑name” reuse silently mutates describedEntity. USM already made scope moves explicit. **KindBridge** does the same for kinds: **declare the mapping**, rate its **congruence**, and capture known **losses**.


### C.3.3:3 - Problem

1. **Semantic drift.** Moving a claim into a target‑context with a different taxonomy changes “what counts” without anyone noticing.
2. **Hidden order breaks.** Subkind relationships invert or vanish; downstream proofs/tests are misapplied.
3. **Entangled channels.** Teams conflate “scope mapping” with “kind mapping,” making it impossible to assign penalties coherently.
4. **Incomputable guards.** “We map it somehow” yields non‑deterministic classification at guard time.


### C.3.3:4 - Forces

| Force                                    | Tension to resolve                                                                              |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Minimal disclosure vs precision**      | Bridges must be light to write yet precise enough to avoid semantic drift.                      |
| **Local autonomy vs global reuse**       | Each target‑context keeps its vocabulary; reuse requires explicit, reviewable mappings.                   |
| **Typed safety vs agility**              | We need typed compatibility checks without blocking exploratory reuse.                          |
| **Separate channels vs operator burden** | Two channels (Scope & Kind) must be explicit, but guard writers shouldn’t drown in boilerplate. |


### C.3.3:5 - Solution — The **KindBridge** object (overview)

A **KindBridge** connects **source** Context **A** and **target** Context **B** for a set of kinds. It declares:

1. **Mapping of kinds**: either to named target kinds or via **signature translation** rules.
2. **Order preservation**: which `⊑` links are preserved (monotone), which are **collapsed**, and which are **unknown** (not claimed).
3. **Type‑congruence `CL^k`**: reuses the **same anchors/labels** as **CL** (Part B) but applies to kind intent/order (not to Scope). *Gloss:* higher `CL^k` ⇒ closer preservation of kind intent and declared `⊑` links.
4. **Loss notes**: human‑readable list of invariants and subkinds **not preserved**.
5. **Definedness area**: the subset of `U.ContextSlice` characteristics where the mapping is **intended** to be used (e.g., certain Standards/versions).
6. **Determinism**: fixed versions + mapping rules ⇒ deterministic result (no “latest”).

**Effect on assurance.** When a **claim** in B depends on classification that goes through this bridge, **reduce R** by a monotone penalty **Ψ(`CL^k`)**. **Do not** change **F** or **G**.


### C.3.3:6 - Norms & Invariants (normative)

> The following formalize the **KB‑01…KB‑12** rules announced in C.3.

#### C.3.3:6.1 - Subject & Scope of a KindBridge

**KB‑01 (Subject).** A KindBridge **maps**:

* one or more **KindSignature**(s) from source to target; and
* an **explicitly declared subset of `⊑` links** (which it claims to preserve or collapse).

**KB‑02 (No Scope).** A KindBridge **MUST NOT** map Claim/Work scope (**G**). Scope translation uses the **USM Bridge + CL** channel (A.2.6, Part B).

**No blended score.** Congruence for Scope (**CL**) and for Kind (**CL^k**) **MUST NOT** be aggregated into a single “interoperability” score in guards; each channel is assessed and penalized **separately**. See **Annex C.3.A §5 (E‑06)**.


#### C.3.3:6.2 - Declaration & Shape

**KB‑03 (Declaration).** A KindBridge record **SHALL** include:

1. source/target Contexts and vocabulary/Standard **versions**;
2. a **kind mapping** per source kind `k`: either a **named** target kind `k′` or a **signature translation rule** that constructs the **target‑context** `KindSignature(k′)` (the result is owned and versioned in the target Context);
3. an **order preservation claim** for any `k₁ ⊑ k₂` it covers: *preserved* / *collapsed* / *unknown*;
4. **`CL^k`** value (using the CL anchor ladder) labeled **“kind‑congruence”**;
5. **loss notes** (non‑preserved invariants, collapsed subkinds, equality quirks);
6. **definedness area** (constraints on `U.ContextSlice` dimensions where the bridge is meant to apply).

**KB‑04 (Determinism & local evaluation).** Given fixed Context versions and mapping rules, **translateₖ** **MUST** be deterministic (no implicit “latest”). After mapping to `k′`, **membership SHALL be evaluated using the target Context’s own `KindSignature(k′)` and `MemberOf(–, k′, –)`**; source‑context membership results **MUST NOT** be reused as truth in guards (they may be cited as evidence in **R**).

#### C.3.3:6.3 - Order & Monotonicity

**KB‑05 (Monotone order).** If the bridge claims to **preserve** `k₁ ⊑ k₂`, then in the target Context **`translateₖ(k₁) ⊑′ translateₖ(k₂)`** **MUST** hold.
**KB‑06 (No inversions).** The bridge **MUST NOT** assert preserved links that **invert** order. If real‑world constraints force reversal, the link **MUST** be marked **not preserved** with a **loss note**.
**KB‑07 (Collapse semantics).** Marking a link as **collapsed** is allowed (two subkinds mapped to one target kind), but the record **SHALL** list the merged subkinds and any properties thereby lost.

#### C.3.3:6.4 - Congruence & Assurance

**KB‑08 (Anchor reuse & AT neutrality).** **`CL^k`** reuses the **ordinal anchor semantics** of CL (Part B) but applies **to kinds**. Editors **SHALL** label it explicitly as **kind‑congruence** to avoid confusion with Scope CL. **KindBridge records MUST NOT compute or alter KindAT (C.3.5 AT‑04); AT is editorial and independent of `CL^k`.**
**KB‑09 (Effect on R only).** When a claim in the target Context depends on `MemberOf(–, translateₖ(k), TargetSlice)`, a **monotone penalty `Ψ(CL^k)`** **SHALL** reduce **R** (alongside any `Φ(CL)` penalty from the Scope Bridge). Implementations **MUST NOT** adjust **F or G** due to `CL^k`.
**KB‑10 (Chaining).** For a chain of bridges, **effective `CL^k` = min** of the links (weakest‑link).

#### C.3.3:6.5 - Loss Notes & Definedness

**KB‑11 (Loss notes).** Bridges **SHALL** publish human‑readable **loss notes**: which invariants of `KindSignature` are **not preserved**, which subkinds are **collapsed**, and any **higher‑equality** caveats (e.g., up‑to‑iso only).
**KB‑12 (Definedness & guard use).** The bridge’s **definedness area** **SHALL** be stated. Guards **MUST fail closed** outside it (i.e., if a classification relies on the bridge where it is not defined, the guard denies use).


### C.3.3:7 - Interactions (informative)

#### C.3.3:7.1 - With USM Scope bridges (two channels)

When using a claim across Contexts, expect **two concurrent bridges**:

* **Scope Bridge (USM)**: maps **G**; publishes **CL**; penalty **Φ(CL)** to **R**.
* **KindBridge (this pattern)**: maps **kinds**; publishes **`CL^k`**; penalty **Ψ(`CL^k`)** to **R**.

**Discipline:** compute both; **do not** collapse them into one “interoperability score.”

 See **Annex C.3.A §5 (E‑01)** for the normative evaluation order in guards.

#### C.3.3:7.2 - With membership (C.3.2)

After mapping `k` to `k′ = translateₖ(k)`, the **target Context** evaluates membership **as usual**: `MemberOf(e, k′, TargetSlice)`. If the bridge provides a **signature translation**, that definition becomes the **local** `KindSignature(k′)` (versioned per target Context policy).

#### C.3.3:7.3 - With Role masks (C.3.4)

If a claim uses a **RoleMask(k)** across Contexts, you need:

* a **KindBridge** for `k` (`CL^k` + loss notes), and
* a documented **mask adapter** (how mask constraints translate).
  Penalties still land in **R**. If the mask’s effect is stable and widely reused, consider promoting it to a **subkind** on the target side.

#### C.3.3:7.4 - With guards (Annex C.3.A)

Use the **`Guard_XContext_Typed`** macro (Annex C.3.A), which requires **both bridges** and applies **both penalties** to **R**:

* find Scope bridge (CL≥threshold), translate **G**, check coverage;
* find KindBridge (`CL^k≥threshold`), translate **kind**, check **membership definedness**;
* apply **Φ(CL)** and **Ψ(`CL^k`)** to **R**; keep **F/G** untouched.


### C.3.3:8 - Authoring, Review & Rating Guidance (informative)

#### C.3.3:8.1 - Authoring a KindBridge

* **Start narrow & honest.** Declare only the kinds and `⊑` links you **actually preserve**; mark the rest **unknown**.
* **Prefer named targets.** If the target already has a suitable kind, map to it; use **signature translation** only when necessary, and list what’s preserved vs weakened vs dropped.
* **Write loss notes in plain language.** Example: “EV vs ICE subkinds collapsed; battery‑health invariants dropped.”
* **Fix the definedness area.** Bind to target Standards/versions and any environment selectors essential to classification.
* **Assign `CL^k` from exemplars.** Calibrate on concrete counter‑examples and preserved properties; resist optimistic ratings.

#### C.3.3:8.2 - Review playbook (10 minutes)

1. **Two bridges present?** Scope Bridge **and** KindBridge?
2. **Order claims honest?** Any `⊑` inversions? Collapses disclosed?
3. **`CL^k` plausible?** Based on preserved properties, not name similarity?
4. **Loss notes present?** Will they force narrowing of Scope or extra tests?
5. **Definedness area clear?** Guard will **fail closed** outside it?
6. **Penalties wired to R?** No hidden tweaks to **F/G**?

#### C.3.3:8.3 - Rating `CL^k` (rules of thumb)

* **High `CL^k`**: signature equivalence or **up‑to‑iso**; `⊑` fragment preserved; only cosmetic losses.
* **Medium `CL^k`**: some invariants weakened; selected subkinds collapsed; order preserved on critical path.
* **Low `CL^k`**: name‑only correspondences; properties diverge; order not preserved. Expect significant **R** penalty and/or adapters.


### C.3.3:9 - Worked Examples (informative)

#### C.3.3:9.1 - Vehicle → TransportUnit (manufacturing)

**Source kind:** `Vehicle` (K2, signature F4).
**target Context:** `PlantB`, kind `TransportUnit` exists.

**KindBridge:**

* `Vehicle ↦ TransportUnit`; **order**: preserves `PassengerCar ⊑ Vehicle`; **collapses** `EV ⊑ Vehicle` into `TransportUnit` (no EV subkind).
* **`CL^k=2`** (mid); **loss notes:** “battery‑health invariants not carried”; **definedness:** only for `registryAPI v1.4`, `Γ_time` in last 365 d.

**Use:** Claim quantified over `Vehicle` crosses to `PlantB`.
**Guards:** scope bridge CL=2 (rig bias); kind bridge `CL^k=2`; both penalties reduce **R**. **F/G** unchanged.

#### C.3.3:9.2 - AuthenticatedRequest across services (software)

**Source kind:** `AuthenticatedRequest` defined by `AuthStandard v2.3`.
**target Context:** `Frontend` with different auth header scheme.

**KindBridge:** signature translation (`authHeader` → `x‑auth`), preserves “signature valid” property; **`CL^k=3`** (high).
**Loss notes:** none; **definedness:** only where `AuthStandard v2.3` is in scope.

**Effect:** Rules quantified over `AuthenticatedRequest` can be reused; **R** penalty small (Ψ(3) near 1). Scope remains independent (API v2.3).

#### C.3.3:9.3 - AdultPatient across jurisdictions (clinical)

**Source kind:** `AdultPatient` (≥ 18 at `Γ_time`).
**target Context:** `JurisdictionY` uses ≥ 21.

**KindBridge:** `AdultPatient ↦ AdultPerson_Y` with boundary mismatch; **`CL^k=1`**.
**Loss notes:** “Boundary 18 vs 21; map narrows to ≥ 21”.
**Guard:** Require **mask adapter** or **narrow Scope** to cohorts where DOB is known and ≥ 21. **R** penalty strong; **F/G** remain as declared.

| Anti‑pattern                                 | Why it’s wrong                         | Remedy                                                                              |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| One “interop score” for both kind & scope    | Blurs channels; corrupts penalties     | Use **two bridges**; apply **Φ(CL)** (Scope) and **Ψ(`CL^k`)** (Kind) **separately** |
| Claiming preserved `⊑` while inverting order | Makes typed reasoning unsound          | Mark as **not preserved**; add **loss note**; consider adapter or subkind redesign  |
| Hiding collapses                             | Overstates coverage                    | List collapsed subkinds explicitly; plan extra **R** for lost granularity           |
| “Latest mapping”                             | Non‑deterministic; non‑auditable       | Version bridges; bind to Standards/versions; **fail closed** outside definedness    |
| Using KindBridge to widen G                  | Conflates describedEntity with applicability | Keep Scope edits in **USM** (ΔG±); KindBridge never widens Scope                    |
| Adjusting F/G for poor `CL^k`                 | Violates F–G–R & USM separation             | Route consequences to **R** only; consider narrowing Scope or adding adapters       |


### C.3.3:11 - Conformance Checklist (normative)

| ID        | Requirement                                                                                                                                          |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **KB‑01** | A KindBridge **maps** `KindSignature`(s) and an explicitly declared subset of `⊑` links.                                                             |
| **KB‑02** | A KindBridge **MUST NOT** map Scope; Scope uses USM Bridge (Part B).                                                                                 |
| **KB‑03** | Bridge records **SHALL** include Contexts/versions, kind mapping/rules, order‑preservation claims, **`CL^k`**, **loss notes**, and **definedness area**. |
| **KB‑04** | Mapping **MUST** be **deterministic** given fixed versions/rules (no “latest”).                                                                      |
| **KB‑05** | Preserved order links **MUST** stay **monotone**: `k₁ ⊑ k₂` ⇒ `translateₖ(k₁) ⊑′ translateₖ(k₂)`.                                                    |
| **KB‑06** | **No inversions**: preserved links cannot invert order; otherwise mark **not preserved** and add loss notes.                                         |
| **KB‑07** | **Collapses** are allowed but **MUST** list merged subkinds and lost properties.                                                                     |
| **KB‑08** | **`CL^k`** **SHALL** reuse CL anchors and be labeled **“kind‑congruence.”**                                                                           |
| **KB‑09** | **Penalties:** when classification uses KindBridge, apply **Ψ(`CL^k`)** to **R**; **MUST NOT** adjust **F/G**.                                        |
| **KB‑10** | **Chaining:** effective `CL^k` across a chain is **min** (weakest‑link).                                                                              |
| **KB‑11** | **Loss notes** **SHALL** enumerate non‑preserved invariants and collapsed subkinds.                                                                  |
| **KB‑12** | **Definedness:** bridge **SHALL** state its valid area; guards **fail closed** outside it.                                                           |

**Integration requirements with Part B (bridges):**

* **B‑P1.** Part B (Bridges) **SHALL** list **KindBridge** as a distinct bridge class alongside USM Scope bridges.
* **B‑P2.** Part B **SHALL** state that **`CL^k` penalties route to R** via a monotone **Ψ**, never to **F/G**.
* **B‑P3.** Part B **SHALL** define **chaining = min** for both **CL** and **`CL^k`** (weakest‑link).
* **Templates.** ESG/Method templates should expose fields for **Scope Bridge (CL)** and **KindBridge (`CL^k`)** with loss notes & definedness.
