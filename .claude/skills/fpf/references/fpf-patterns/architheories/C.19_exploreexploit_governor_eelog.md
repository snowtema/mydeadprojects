## C.19 - Explore–Exploit Governor (E/E‑LOG)

**Status.** Logic specification (**LOG**). Defines exploration/exploitation policies and selection lenses. **No Γ operators** are exported; policies parameterize calls in **C.18 NQD‑CAL**.

### C.19:1 - Problem frame
The E/E governor provides named, versioned policies and lenses that steer NQD generation/selection under lawful dominance and provenance constraints.

### C.19:2 - Problem
Ad‑hoc exploration mixes ordinal and interval folds, silently scalarises posets, and loses lens/policy provenance—undermining legality and reproducibility.

### C.19:3 - Forces
• Trust gates vs. discovery — graduation requires backstop confidence while maintaining explore_share.
• Heterogeneity vs. focus — fairness quotas by family vs. depth on proven lines.
• Lens expressiveness vs. audit — scalarised choices must not be called 'the frontier' and MUST record lens ids.

### C.19:4 - Solution
Define EmitterPolicy (class, params, ε, K, insertion/dedup) and selection lenses with a fixed pipeline (Eligibility → Dominance → Tie‑breakers); bind provenance (policy id, lens id) and guard promotions of Surprise/Illumination to dominance to explicit policy declarations.

**Agency note.** Decisions are taken by a **system in role**. **Contexts publish** measurement spaces and admissible policies as **semantic frames**; LOG profiles lenses and policies but does **not** enact choices.
**Depends on.** **C.18 NQD‑CAL** (generators), **C.17 Creativity‑CHR** (measurements), **Decsn‑CAL** (objectives/constraints, scalarization lenses), **B.3** (trust adjustments), **Compose‑CAL** (set aggregation; advisory).

**EmitterPolicy (named profile).** A context‑local, versioned policy with fields:
`{ name, class ∈ {UCB, Thompson, BO‑EI, GP‑UCB, PES, …}, params, explore_share∈[0,1], temperature τ≥0, rebalance_period, wild_bet_quota≥0, backstop_confidence (assurance level), epsilon_dominance ε, cell_capacity K, **insertion_policy**, **dedup_threshold** }`.
Policies are referenced as `U.EmitterPolicyRef` by NQD generator call (C.18) and are conceptual lenses, not staffing/budget instructions.

**Defaults (if policy is unspecified):**  
• **Dominance:** `{Q components}` with `ConstraintFit=pass` as **eligibility gate**.  
• **Tie‑breakers:** `Novelty@context`, `ΔDiversity_P`, `Surprise`; `Illumination` (telemetry over Diversity_P: coverage/QD‑score) MAY be used as a tie‑breaker but is **not** in the dominance set.  
• **Archive:** `K=1`, `ε=0`, deduplication in `CharacteristicSpace`.  
• **Policy:** UCB‑class with moderate temperature; `explore_share ≈ 0.3–0.5`.  
• **Provenance (minimum):** record `DescriptorMapRef.edition`, `DistanceDefRef.edition`, `DHCMethodRef.edition`, `EmitterPolicyRef`, `InsertionPolicyRef`, `dedup_threshold?`, `TimeWindow`, `Seeds`.

**Scalarization lenses (policy‑level).** A lens `J_ℓ` declares: (a) hard eligibility conditions (e.g., ConstraintFit=pass), (b) soft aggregation (weights/curves), (c) trust policy (how assurance/CL discounts enter).  
**Conformance.** A Context MUST name the lens used to pick from a frontier; scalarized rankings MUST NOT be presented as “the frontier”; the **`lens id MUST be recorded in provenance of each selection`**.

**Promotion rules (policy).**  
- **Tie‑breaks.**  `Surprise` and `Illumination` MAY act as tie‑breakers; **promotion into the dominance set MUST be declared by lens or policy id** and captured in provenance.
- **Graduation.** Profiles graduate from Explore→Exploit when **backstop_confidence** (B.3 level) and eligibility conditions are met.  
- **Sunset/Pivot.** Profiles failing VOI/backstop thresholds are sunset or pivoted at `rebalance_period`.

**Explore/Exploit loop (per rebalance_period).**
1) Recompute frontier with trust discounts.  
2) Enforce `explore_share` (minimum attention on high‑Novelty, not‑yet‑proven profiles).  
3) Update generator `temperature τ` / emitter mix.  
4) Apply `backstop_confidence` to graduate; sunset stale probes.  
5) Satisfy `wild_bet_quota` by seeding fresh high‑Novelty candidates.
6) HET‑FIRST — apply group‑fairness quotas by domain‑family and/or DPP/Max‑min repulsion before exploit lenses; log quotas and sampler policy id.

**Named lenses (heuristics; policy‑level, not norms)**
The following **lens profiles** are **illustrative heuristics**. Contexts MAY reuse/modify them; they are **not** normative.
• **Frontier‑sweeper** — maintain attention on the full front; promote only when `backstop_confidence` holds.  
• **Barbell** — enforce `explore_share ≥ θ` with a `wild_bet_quota`; otherwise exploit top‑trust region.  
• **Spike‑first** — pick highest **Use‑Value** subject to `ConstraintFit=pass` and a small **Cost‑to‑Probe** cap.  
• **Safety‑first** — minimize **SafetyRisk** subject to `Use‑Value ≥ θ` and `ConstraintFit=pass`.  
• **Platform‑option** — maximize **Option‑Value** under probe cost bounds.  
• **Pilot‑then‑scale** — optimize **Use‑Value** on pilot scope with `BackstopConfidence ≥ L1`; widen `G` once **R** holds.  
• **Heterogeneity‑first (policy id).** Eligibility → Dominance → Tie‑breakers; Hard gate: FamilyCoverage ≥ k, MinInterFamilyDistance ≥ δ_family; Fairness quotas: ≤1 candidate per sub‑family at pre‑front sampling; DPP/Max‑min sampler allowed.
**Conformance (lens recording).** A decision that uses any lens **MUST** record its **lens id** alongside `EmitterPolicyRef`. (This restates and localizes C19‑3.)

### C.19:5 - Conformance Checklist
- **C19‑1** Each NQD generator call (C.18) **SHALL** cite `U.EmitterPolicyRef` (policy id + params) **and the active `InsertionPolicyRef`/`dedup_threshold` when not inherited**.
- **C19‑2** The characteristic set & signs used for dominance **MUST** be declared; eligibility conditions applied first. *(References to C.18 generator operators are descriptive only; LOG exports no Γ.)*
- **C19‑3** If a lens is used, its id MUST be recorded; do not label scalarized top‑1 as “frontier”.  
- **C19‑4** Promotion of Surprise/Illumination into dominance MUST be explicit in policy.  
- **C19‑5** USM/RSG gate applies: policy actions SHALL operate within the Context’s scope and enactable RSG states.
- **C19‑6** Each selection lens **MUST** implement and document the pipeline` Eligibility (ConstraintFit=pass) → Dominance (declared set) → Tie‑breakers (declared)`. Any **promotion** of Surprise/Illumination into the dominance set **MUST** be named by lens/policy id and recorded in provenance.
- **C19‑7 (LEX‑AUTH trigger).** Any change to `EmitterPolicy` defaults that affects domain‑family quotas/samplers (HET‑FIRST), or any change to `DescriptorMap` family coordinates, `DistanceDef`, or the `δ_family` threshold MUST be authored via **E.15 LEX‑AUTH** with a published **LAT**; the DRR SHALL carry the LAT pointer (see **CC‑DRR.6**). Record policy/card ids in SCR.
- **C19‑8**  When the Heterogeneity‑first lens is used, provenance MUST include: (i) the family‑quota vector (including the default triad quota k), (ii) the subFamilyDef id (from F1‑Card) if sub‑family quotas apply, (iii) the sampler class, seed, and policy id.

**Illumination & Diversity_P.** Illumination is **report‑only telemetry over `Diversity_P`** (coverage/QD‑score; published as `IlluminationSummary`). It informs exploration health and tie‑breaks; it is **not** a dominance characteristic by default.

When **Name Cards** (F.18) use NQD-CAL for lexical search, the underlying `DescriptorMap` and `Diversity_P` **MUST** follow the **head-term family** discipline:  
– group label candidates into families by lexical head (base noun/verb, ignoring minor prepositions and inflection);  
– compute `Diversity_P` and any illumination/coverage telemetry over these families (cf. `FamilyCoverage`, `AliasRisk`), not over individual string variants.  
This requirement prevents treating small morphological tweaks of one head as a “diverse” frontier and keeps lexical NQD-fronts honest.

**Baseline profile (informative, context‑local template).**
`EmitterPolicy#NQD-Default-2025`:
    class=`UCB`, explore_share=`0.3–0.5`, temperature `τ=moderate`,
    rebalance_period=`Context default`, wild_bet_quota=`≥0`,
    backstop_confidence=`policy L1`, epsilon_dominance=`ε=0`,
    cell_capacity=`K=1`.
Contexts MAY clone/adjust; if used, record its id in provenance.

**Didactic quickstart (Context).**
- Start with policy class = `UCB` or `Thompson`; set `explore_share≈0.3–0.5`, `τ` moderate.  
- Name the dominance set: `{Q components, Novelty@context, ΔDiversity_P}` with `ConstraintFit=pass` as gate.  
  *(Use‑Value / Cost‑to‑Probe may appear in **lenses** or **constraints**; they are **not** in the default dominance set.)*
- Pick a lens for the final choice (or stick to frontier if undecided); record the lens id in the decision memo.

### C.19:6 - Archetypal Grounding
**System.** Policy‑driven A/B of architectural variants: Eligibility = constraint‑fit; Dominance = {Q components, Novelty@context, ΔDiversity_P}; lens = 'Frontier‑sweeper' vs 'Barbell'.
**Episteme.** Method‑family portfolio in SoTA pack: fairness quotas across traditions; lens id recorded; Illumination used as tie‑breaker only unless promoted.

### C.19:7 - Bias‑Annotation
No global scalarisation of partial orders; ordinal scales excluded from arithmetic; all selections record lens id and policy id; notation/tool neutrality.

### C.19:8 - Consequences
• Transparent exploration budgets. • Repeatable lens‑based selections. • Heterogeneity preserved without illegal aggregates.

### C.19:9 - Rationale
Post‑2015 exploration practice (bandits/BO/RL with QD) shows policies must be explicit, auditable, and editioned; LOG provides that governance.

### C.19:10 - Relations
Builds on: Decsn‑CAL, B.3. Coordinates with: C.18, C.17, G.5, G.9.
