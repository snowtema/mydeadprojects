## A.10 - Evidence Graph Referring (C‑4)

*“A claim without a chain is only an opinion.”*

### A.10:1 - Context

FPF is a holonic framework: wholes are built from parts (A.1, A.14), and reasoning travels across scales via Γ‑flavours (B.1). To keep this reasoning honest and reproducible, every **published assertion** must be *anchored* in concrete **symbol carriers** and **well‑typed transformations** performed by an **external TransformerRole** (A.12, A.15). **Publication** itself is the typed projection **I→D→S** (`Publ_ID`, `Formalize_DS`) per A.7 and is **not execution**; any physical/digital release, rendering, or upload is **Work** by an external transformer **on carriers**, cited in SCR.

Managers can read this as a simple rule of thumb:
> **Claim → (Proof or Test) → Confidence badge**
> …where the proof/test is traceable to real carriers and to an external system/Transformer who executed an agreed method.

This pattern defines the **Evidence Graph Referring Standard** common to all Γ‑flavours (Γ\_sys — formerly Γ\_core, Γ\_epist, Γ\_method, Γ\_time, Γ\_work) and clarifies:
(a) the difference between **mereology** (part‑whole; builds holarchies) and **provenance** (why a claim is admissible; does *not* build holarchies);
(b) the run‑time / design‑time separation (A.4) across **Role–Method–Work** (A.15).


### A.10:2 - Problem

Without a uniform anchor, models drift into five failure modes:

1. **Weightless claims.** Metrics or arguments appear in the model with no link to their **symbol carriers** (files, datasets, lab notebooks, figures).
2. **Collapsed scopes.** Design‑time method specs are silently mixed with run‑time traces; results cannot be reproduced because “what was planned” and “what actually ran” are conflated.
3. **Self‑justifying loops.** A holon attempts to evidence itself (violates A.12 externality), producing cyclic provenance and unverifiable conclusions.
4. **Source loss during aggregation.** As Γ combines parts, some sources “fall out”; later audit cannot reconstruct why a compound claim was accepted.
5. **Temporal ambiguity.** Time‑series are aggregated without interval coverage or dating source; gaps/overlaps invalidate comparisons and trend claims.

The business effect is predictable: confidence badges cannot be defended, cross‑scale consistency (A.9) is broken, and iteration slows because every review re‑litigates “where did this come from?”.


### A.10:3 - Forces

| Force                           | Tension                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Universality vs. burden**     | One Standard must fit systems and epistemes ↔ Authors should not drown in paperwork.                                                              |
| **Externality vs. reflexivity** | Evidence must be produced by an external TransformerRole (A.12) ↔ Some systems adapt themselves (need reflexive modelling without self‑evidence). |
| **Atemporal vs. temporal**      | Many claims are state‑like ↔ Many others are histories; evidence must respect order and coverage (Γ\_time).                                       |
| **Rigor vs. flow**              | Formal proofs and controlled tests raise confidence ↔ Engineering cadence needs lightweight, incremental anchors.                                 |
| **Mereology vs. provenance**    | Part‑whole edges build holarchies ↔ Evidence edges never do; the two graphs must interlock without leaking semantics.                             |


### A.10:4 - Solution — The Evidence Graph Referring Standard

The Standard is a small set of primitives applied uniformly, with **manager‑first clarity** and **formal hooks** for proof obligations.

#### A.10:4.1 - EPV‑DAG (Evidence–Provenance DAG).
A **typed, acyclic** graph disjoint from mereology. Node types: **SymbolCarrier** (a `U.System` in **CarrierRole**, A.15), **TransformerRole** (external Transformer, A.12), **MethodDescription** (design‑time blueprint of a method, A.15), **Observation** (a dated assertion/result), **U.Episteme** (knowledge holon). Edge vocabulary is small and normative: `evidences`, `derivedFrom`, `measuredBy`, `interpretedBy`, `usedCarrier`, `happenedBefore` (temporal), etc.
*Manager view:* it is the *“because‑graph”*: every claim answers “because of these carriers, by this Transformer, using that method, then.”

#### A.10:4.2 - Anchors (two relations, two flavours).**

* `verifiedBy` — links a claim to **formal** evidence (proof obligations, static guarantees, model‑checking artefacts).
* `validatedBy` — links a claim to **empirical** evidence (tests, measurements, trials, observations).
  Both anchors terminate in the EPV‑DAG, not in the mereology graph.

#### A.10:4.3 SCR / RSCR (Symbol Carrier Registers).
Every `Γ_epist` aggregation **SHALL** emit an **SCR**: an exhaustive register of **symbol carriers** materially used in the aggregate, with id, type, version/date, checksum, source/conditions and optional `PortionOf` (A.14) for sub‑carriers.
Every `Γ_epist^compile` **SHALL** emit an **RSCR**: SCR specialised to a **bounded context** (vocabularies, units) with publication‑grade identifiers and hashes.
*Why this matters:* it prevents “lost sources” during composition and underwrites reproducibility without mandating any specific tool.

#### A.10:4.4 Scope alignment (A.4) across Role–Method–Work (A.15).

* **Design‑time**: **MethodDescription** lives here; methods are blueprints; anchors reference what *would* constitute proof or test.
* **Run‑time**: **Work** (actual execution) lives here; traces reference which MethodDescription they instantiate and record `happenedBefore`.
  Bridging edges are explicit (“this run trace instantiates that spec”), so scopes never silently mix.

#### A.10:4.5 External TransformerRole (A.12).
The system that produces or interprets evidence is **external** to the holon under evaluation. If true reflexivity is essential, model a **meta‑holon** (A.12): the self‑updating holon becomes the *object* of a higher‑level external transformer (the “mirror”), restoring objectivity.

#### A.10:4.6 Γ‑flavour hooks (how each flavour anchors).

* **Γ\_sys (formerly Γ\_core)**: physical properties are anchored by measurement models, boundary conditions, calibration carriers, and dated observations.
* **Γ\_epist**: always outputs SCR/RSCR; every provenance/evidence node resolves to an SCR/RSCR entry.
* **Γ\_method**: order‑sensitive composition; at design‑time a **Method Instantiation Card (MIC)** states `Precedes/Choice/Join` and guards; at run‑time traces record `happenedBefore` and point to the MethodDescription they instantiate.
* **Γ\_time**: temporal claims state interval coverage; **Monotone Coverage** (no unexplained gaps/overlaps) is required.
* **Γ\_work**: resource spending and yield are evidenced by instrumented carriers (meters, logs) and their MethodDescriptions; keep **resource rosters** separate from SCR/RSCR.

> **Manager’s shortcut:** If you can answer *what carriers, which system, which method, when*, the anchor is likely sufficient; if any of the four is missing, it is not.

### A.10:6 - Conformance Checklist

| ID                                      | Requirement                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Purpose (what it prevents)                                 |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CC‑A10.1 (EPV‑DAG Presence)**         | Every published claim MUST have a path in the Evidence–Provenance DAG (EPV‑DAG) to concrete **SymbolCarrier** nodes and to the **external** `TransformerRole` that produced or interpreted the evidence.                                | Stops “weightless claims” and self‑justifying text.        |
| **CC‑A10.2 (SCR)**                      | Any `Γ_epist^synth` operation SHALL output an **SCR** listing all symbol carriers materially used in the aggregate `U.Episteme`.                                                                                                        | Prevents source loss during aggregation.                   |
| **CC‑A10.3 (RSCR)**                     | Any `Γ_epist^compile` operation SHALL output an **RSCR** adapted to the target bounded context (vocabularies, units) with publication‑grade identifiers/hashes; SCR→RSCR MUST preserve carrier identity/integrity.                      | Keeps releases auditable and context‑consistent.           |
| **CC‑A10.4 (Resolution)**               | Every provenance/evidence node in the dependency graph MUST be resolvable to an SCR/RSCR entry. Unresolved links invalidate the claim.                                                                                                  | Eliminates dangling references and unverifiable citations. |
| **CC‑A10.5 (Scope Separation)**         | A single EPV‑DAG instance SHALL NOT mix design‑time MethodDescription nodes with run‑time Work traces. Bridges (“this run trace instantiates that spec”) MUST be explicit.                                                                     | Avoids conflating intent and execution.                    |
| **CC‑A10.6 (Externality)**              | The evidencing `TransformerRole` MUST be **external** to the holon under evaluation (A.12). Reflexive cases require modelling a meta‑holon and an external mirror.                                                                      | Prevents self‑creation/self‑evidence paradoxes.            |
| **CC‑A10.7 (Temporal Coverage)**        | For `Γ\_time` claims, interval coverage MUST be monotone and fully specified; gaps/overlaps require explicit justification or rejection.                                                                                                 | Stops invalid time‑series aggregation.                     |
| **CC‑A10.8 (Integrity & Immutability)** | SCR/RSCR entries MUST include version/date and checksums; published SCR/RSCR are immutable—updates create a new revision id with a pointer to the prior one.                                                                            | Guards against silent drift and tampering.                 |
| **CC‑A10.9 (Holarchy Firewall)**        | EPV‑DAG MUST use provenance edges only; mereological edges (`ComponentOf`, `MemberOf`, `PortionOf`, `PhaseOf`, etc.) MUST NOT appear in EPV‑DAG; conversely, provenance edges MUST NOT be used to build holarchies.                     | Keeps part‑whole and evidence semantics disjoint.          |
| **CC‑A10.10 (Γ\_sys Anchors)**          | Physical claims aggregated by `Γ_sys` MUST reference measurement models (quantity, unit, uncertainty), boundary conditions, and calibration carriers.                                                                                   | Ensures physical plausibility and comparability.           |
| **CC‑A10.11 (Γ\_method Anchors)**       | For order‑sensitive composition, design‑time MUST include a **Method Instantiation Card (MIC)** (Precedes/Choice/Join, guards, exceptions); run‑time traces MUST record `happenedBefore` and reference the MethodDescription they instantiate. | Preserves order semantics and reproducibility.             |
| **CC‑A10.12 (Γ\_work Anchors)**         | Resource spending/yield claims MUST be evidenced by instrumented carriers (meters, logs) and their MethodDescriptions; resource **rosters** MUST NOT be conflated with SCR/RSCR.                                                               | Distinguishes cost accounting from knowledge carriers.     |

**Manager’s audit (non‑normative, quick):** For any claim, ask **What carriers? Which system? Which method? When?** If any answer is missing, A.10 is not satisfied.


### A.10:7 - Consequences

| Benefit                           | Why it matters                                                                  | Trade‑off / Mitigation                                                                                                                |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cross‑scale reproducibility**   | Any composite metric or argument can be walked back to its carriers and method. | **Overhead** of maintaining SCR/RSCR. *Mitigation:* keep entries minimal but complete; use checklists from the pedagogical companion. |
| **Design/run clarity**            | Intent (MethodDescription) is cleanly separated from execution (Work traces).          | **Discipline** needed at boundaries. *Mitigation:* MIC templates; explicit “instantiates” bridges.                                    |
| **Objective evidence**            | External `TransformerRole` eliminates self‑evidence loops.                      | **Reflexive systems** require a mirror meta‑holon. *Mitigation:* provide a “reflexive modelling” appendix with examples.              |
| **Comparable numbers over time**  | Temporal coverage invariants prevent “trend” claims built on gaps.              | **Extra dating work** for legacy data. *Mitigation:* allow provisional labels until dating is completed.                              |
| **Safe composition of knowledge** | SCR/RSCR keep sources intact as Γ\_epist composes epistemes.                    | **Initial friction** in teams new to carrier thinking. *Mitigation:* start with “top‑10 carriers per claim” rule, expand as needed.   |
| **Feeds Trust Calculus (B.3)**    | Anchors provide the inputs (R, CL, etc.) needed to score confidence.            | —                                                                                                                                     |


### A.10:8 - Rationale (SoTA alignment, reader‑friendly)

* **Metrology & assurance.** The requirement to name quantities, units, uncertainty, calibration carriers reflects long‑standing metrology practice and modern assurance cases: numbers are only comparable when their **measurement models** are stated.
* **Knowledge provenance.** The EPV‑DAG and SCR/RSCR embody post‑2015 best practices in provenance for knowledge artefacts: keep a complete, machine‑checkable trail from claims to carriers; separate provenance from part‑whole.
* **Temporal reasoning.** Monotone coverage (no unexplained gaps/overlaps) aligns with temporal knowledge graph practice and avoids “impossible histories.”
* **Holonic parsimony.** By drawing a firewall between **mereology** (A.14) and **provenance**, A.10 prevents semantic leakage and keeps the holarchy well‑typed.
* **Role–Method–Work clarity.** Anchoring explicitly rides on A.15: **roles** act via **methods** specified at design‑time and produce **work** observed at run‑time. This keeps agency, policy, and execution disentangled yet connected.


### A.10:9 - Relations

* **Builds on:** A.1 Holonic Foundation; A.4 Temporal Duality; **A.12 Transformer Externalization**; **A.14 Advanced Mereology**; **A.15 Role–Method–Work Alignment**.
* **Constrains / Used by:** B.1 (all Γ‑flavours: `Γ_sys`, `Γ_epist`, `Γ_method`, `Γ\_time`, `Γ_work`); B.1.1 (Dependency Graph & Proofs).
* **Enables:** **B.3 Trust Calculus** (R/CL inputs, auditability); B.4 Canonical Evolution Loop (clean design/run bridges).

### A.10:10 - Migration (practical and brief)

Apply these text edits:

1. **Terminology**

   * `manifest` → **“Symbol Carrier Register (SCR)”**; `release manifest` → **“Release SCR (RSCR)”**.
   * `creator` / `observer` (as internal evidencer) → **`TransformerRole (external)`**.
   * “symbol register” (ambiguous) → **“Symbol Carrier Register (SCR)”**.
   * Keep **resource rosters** in `Γ_work` separate from SCR/RSCR.

3. **Boilerplate inserts**

   * In **A.10** (this pattern): retain definitions of **EPV‑DAG**, **SCR/RSCR**, and the flavour‑specific anchors.
   * In **B.1.3 (`Γ_epist`)**: add the **Obligations — SCR/RSCR** block (“`Γ_epist^synth` SHALL output SCR… `Γ_epist^compile` SHALL output RSCR…”).
   * In **B.1.5 (`Γ_method`)**: ensure **MIC** is referenced (Precedes/Choice/Join, guards, exceptions) and run‑time traces reference the **MethodDescription** they instantiate.
   * In **B.1.6 (`Γ_work`)**: say “resource rosters are not SCR/RSCR; anchor meter/log readings via EPV‑DAG.”
