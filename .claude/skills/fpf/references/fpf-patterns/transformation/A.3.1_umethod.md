## A.3.1 - U.Method

### A.3.1:1 - Context (plain‑language motivation)

Teams must talk about **how** something is done without entangling:

* **Who** is assigned (that is **Role**/**RoleAssigning**),
* **Whether** the holder can do it (that is **Capability**), and
* **What actually happened** (that is **Work**).

`U.Method` supplies the *how*—the **abstract way of performing a transformation**, independent of a specific run, a specific assignee, or a specific notation. It works across paradigms:

* **Imperative** (step‑graphs, SOPs, BPMN),
* **Functional** (pure mappings and compositions, no “steps”),
* **Logical/constraint/optimization** (goals, rules, admissible solutions).

In FPF, a **system** bearing a **TransformerRole** *enacts* a `U.Method` (producing **Work**) by following a **MethodDescription**—an episteme that describes the method in some representation.

### A.3.1:2 - Problem (what goes wrong without a clean notion of “method”)

1. **Process soup.** “Process” gets used for recipe, execution, schedule, or org area. Planning, staffing, and audit blur together.
2. **Spec = run fallacy.** A flowchart (or code) is taken as if execution already happened; conversely, logs get mistaken for the recipe.
3. **Role leakage.** People encode assignments inside the recipe (“this step is the surgeon”), tying **who** to **how** and making reuse impossible.
4. **Notation lock‑in.** When “method” is defined as “a set of steps,” functional or logical styles become second‑class citizens and cannot be modeled cleanly.

### A.3.1:3 - Forces (what the definition must balance)

| Force                                  | Tension we resolve                                                                                        |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Universality vs. specificity**       | One notion must cover welding, ETL, proofs, and schedulers, while letting each domain keep its idioms.    |
| **Representation vs. semantics**       | Many notations express the same “way of doing”; we need one semantic anchor across specs.                 |
| **Reusability vs. assignment**        | The *how* should be reusable regardless of *who* is assigned this time.                                  |
| **Compositionality vs. executability** | Methods compose (serial/parallel/choice/iteration), but execution may diverge due to conditions/failures. |
| **Determinism vs. search**             | Methods may be deterministic algorithms or constraint problems with admissible solution sets.             |


### A.3.1:4 - Solution — the method as an abstract, paradigm‑agnostic “way of doing”

#### A.3.1:4.1 - Definition

**`U.Method`** is a **context‑defined abstract transformation type**—the **semantic “way of doing”** a kind of work.  
It is:
**Described** (never *identical*) by one or more **`U.MethodDescription`** epistemes (code/SOP/diagram/rules),  
**Enacted** by a `U.System` bearing an appropriate **Role** (usually a **TransformerRole**) to produce **`U.Work`**, and  
**Independent** of who is assigned, what instance ran, or which notation was used.

**Strict Distinction (didactic):**  
* **Method** = *how in principle* (semantic Standard).  
* **MethodDescription** = *how it is written* (artifact on a carrier).  
* **Work** = *how it actually went this time* (dated execution).

#### A.3.1:4.2 - Representation‑agnostic stance (specs may be imperative/functional/logical)

A `U.Method` does **not** require an imperative step structure. **Representations live in `U.MethodDescription`, not in the Method itself.**  
Typical **MethodDescription forms** include:

* **Imperative MethodDescription:** step‑graph/flow (serial/parallel/branch).  
* **Functional MethodDescription:** a composition `f ∘ g ∘ h` with typed interfaces/constraints, no “steps”.  
* **Logical/constraint MethodDescription:** a goal/constraint set with admissible solutions and search/optimization semantics.  
* **Hybrid MethodDescription:** imperative scaffolding with functional kernels and/or solver calls.

**Semantic identity criterion (context‑local).** Two MethodDescriptions **describe the same `U.Method`** in a given `U.BoundedContext` iff, for all admissible inputs and conditions recognized by that context, they entail the **same preconditions**, **guarantee the same postconditions/effects**, and satisfy the **same non‑functional bounds** (allowing permitted non‑determinism). Internal control‑flow/search details may differ.


#### A.3.1:4.3 - Method vs MethodDescription vs Work (quick litmus)

| You have in your hand…           | In FPF it is…                 | Why                                                                             |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A flowchart/BPMN/SOP text        | **`U.MethodDescription`** (Episteme) | A description on a carrier.                                                     |
| A git repo with code | **`U.MethodDescription`** (Episteme) | Still a description (even if executable). The Method is the semantic “way” it denotes. |
| A log/run report with timestamps | **`U.Work`**                  | A concrete event that happened.                                                 |
| “The way we weld seams type W”   | **`U.Method`**                | The abstract *how*, represented by one or more specs and realized by many runs. |

**Didactic rule:** when referencing *the idea* of “how”, say **Method**; when referencing *the document or code*, say **MethodDescription**; when referencing *the run*, say **Work**.

#### A.3.1:4.4 - Interface and effect (conceptual descriptors)

When presenting a `U.Method` in a review, anchor it with these paradigm‑neutral elements (not a data schema):

1. **Interface** — what is required/provided in general (inputs/outputs/types or resources/roles/ports).
2. **Preconditions** — what must already hold (guards, invariants, Standard “requires”).
3. **Postconditions / Effects** — what is guaranteed after successful enactment (Standard “ensures”).
4. **Non‑functional constraints** — latency, accuracy, cost, safety envelope (ties to **Capability** thresholds).
5. **Failure modes** — known failure classes and recoverability hints.
6. **Compositional hooks** — whether this method composes serially/parallel/choice/iteration (see §4.5).

#### A.3.1:4.5 - Method mereology (composition without confusing it with runtime)

Methods compose into bigger methods; executions compose into bigger executions—**do not conflate** the two.

**Method composition (design‑time):** serial (`-`), parallel (`‖`), choice (`|`), iteration (`*`), refinement/substitution—yield **new `U.Method`s**.
**Work composition (run‑time):** the corresponding **Work** may split/merge/overlap differently due to scheduling, failures, or environment, yet it is still **execution of the same Method**.
**Mapping advice:** avoid naming run‑time artifacts inside the method definition (no “this thread”, “this person”); keep those in **Role**/**Work**.

#### A.3.1:4.6 - Constructor‑theoretic reading (why Method ≠ algorithm ≠ spec)

Constructor Theory views a **constructor** as a physical entity that **effects transformations**. In FPF:

* A `U.System` with **TransformerRole** is the constructor (the performer).  
* A **`U.Method`** is the abstract **transformation type** it enacts (semantic Standard).  
* An **algorithm artifact** is a **`U.MethodDescription`** for an **information‑transformation Method**.  
* A **universal transformer** generalizes the **Turing machine** by **executing any `U.Method` described by a physically admissible `U.MethodDescription`** (not only informational ones).

Thus, welding, milling, reagent mixing, and proof construction are all **Methods**; textbooks/code/derivations are their **MethodDescriptions**; **Work** are the concrete runs.

#### A.3.1:4.7 - Context anchoring

`U.Method` is **local to a `U.BoundedContext`**: terminology, admissible pre/postconditions, and non‑functional constraints are interpreted **inside that context**. If two teams or theories use the same name for different “ways of doing,” they are different Methods in different contexts unless bridged explicitly.


### A.3.1:5 - Archetypal grounding (cross-paradigm examples: imperative / functional / logical)

#### A.3.1:5.1 - Industrial transformation (imperative flavor)

* **Method:** `Etch_Al2O3`.
* **MethodDescription:** SOP document; a PLC program that controls gas mix and timing.
* **Enactment:** `Tool_42#TransformerRole:FabLine_A` produces **Work** runs W‑101, W‑102….
* **Notes:** Step diagram exists, but a later **functional** spec may also exist (composition of gas‑flow functions). Both **specs** describe the **same Method**.

#### A.3.1:5.2 - Operational planning (functional/optimization flavor)

* **Method:** `JS_Schedule_v4` (job‑shop scheduling).
* **MethodDescription:** a MILP model + solver configuration; documentation of constraints/objective.
* **Enactment:** `PlannerService_v4#TransformerRole:PlantScheduling_2025` produces **Work** `Run_2025‑W32‑P1`.
* **Notes:** No “steps” are visible at the method level; the solver’s search is internal. Still a `U.Method`.

#### A.3.1:5.3 - Scientific proof (logical flavor)

* **Method:** `Gauss_Elimination`.
* **MethodDescription:** formal rules in a proof assistant; textbook chapter as a second spec.
* **Enactment:** `CAS_Alpha#TransformerRole:MathLab_2025` generates a **Work** proof instance for a concrete matrix.
* **Notes:** The **Episteme** (spec) is not the **ability** (that belongs to the CAS system) and not the **execution** (the proof run).


### A.3.1:6 - Didactic quick grammar (for managers)

* **Who?** `Holder#Role:Context` (**Role assignment**)
* **Can?** `Capability(holder)` within envelope/measures
* **How (in principle)?** **`Method`**, described by **`MethodDescription`**
* **Did?** **`Work`** (execution), linked by `performedBy → RoleAssigning` and `isExecutionOf → MethodDescription`

> *Keep the four words apart and plans become dependable.*


### A.3.1:7 - Bias‑Annotation (as in cluster‑E patterns)

* **Lenses tested:** `Arch`, `Prag`, `Did`, `Epist`.
* **Scope declaration:** Universal; semantics are context‑local via `U.BoundedContext`.
* **Rationale:** Gives FPF a **paradigm‑neutral** “how” that bridges MethodDescription (knowledge on a carrier) and Work (execution), while staying independent of Role (assignment) and Capability (ability).

### A.3.1:8 - Conformance Checklist (normative)

**CC‑A3.1‑1 (Strict Distinction).**
`U.Method` is the **semantic “way of doing”**. It is **not** a `U.MethodDescription` (artifact on a carrier), **not** a `U.Work` (dated execution), **not** a `U.Role`/assignment, and **not** a `U.ServiceClause`/promise.

**CC‑A3.1‑2 (Context anchoring).**
Every `U.Method` **MUST** be defined **within** a `U.BoundedContext`. Identity, admissible pre/postconditions, and non‑functional bounds are interpreted **in that context**.

**CC‑A3.1‑3 (Specification linkage).**
A `U.Method` **SHOULD** be **described by** ≥1 `U.MethodDescription`. For operational gating, at least one `MethodDescription` **MUST** be present and named. Multiple specs may coexist (imperative/functional/logic), see CC‑A3.1‑7.

**CC‑A3.1‑4 (assignment‑free).**
A `U.Method` **SHALL NOT** hard‑code holders or assignments. If a step “needs a surgeon”, express that as a **role requirement** (to be satisfied via `U.RoleAssignment` at run time), not as a named person/unit inside the method.

**CC‑A3.1‑5 (Runtime‑free).**
A `U.Method` **SHALL NOT** contain schedule, calendar slots, or run IDs; those belong to `U.WorkPlan` (plans) and `U.Work` (executions). Methods are timeless.

**CC‑A3.1‑6 (Interface & effects).**
A `U.Method` **MUST** admit a context‑local statement of interface (inputs/outputs or ports/resources), **preconditions**, **postconditions/effects**, and (when relevant) **non‑functional bounds**. These anchor semantic identity beyond a particular notation.

**CC‑A3.1‑7 (Multi‑spec semantic identity).**
Two or more `U.MethodDescription` **describe the same `U.Method`** in a given context **iff** they entail the **same admissible preconditions**, **guarantee the same effects**, and satisfy the **same non‑functional bounds** for all inputs/conditions recognized by that context (allowing permitted non‑determinism). Internal control‑flow/search differences are irrelevant.

**CC‑A3.1‑8 (Composition vs execution).**
Composition of Methods (design‑time) and composition of Work (run‑time) **MUST** be kept distinct. Method composition yields **new Methods**; Work composition yields **composed executions**. They may correspond but are not identical.

**CC‑A3.1‑9 (Parameterization).**
If a Method is parameterized, parameters are **declared** at the Method/MethodDescription level; **concrete values** are bound **at `U.Work` creation**. Avoid freezing parameter values inside the Method definition.

**CC‑A3.1‑10 (Dynamics ≠ Method).**
Laws/trajectories (`U.Dynamics`) are models of state evolution and **SHALL NOT** be labeled as Methods. A Method **may** rely on a Dynamics model (e.g., for control), but they remain distinct artifacts/concepts.

**CC‑A3.1‑11 (Capability checks are orthogonal).**
A step may impose capability thresholds; those thresholds are checked **against the holder’s `U.Capability`** independently of assignment and independently of the Method’s description.

**CC‑A3.1‑12 (Constructor‑theoretic alignment).**
Algorithm artifacts are `U.MethodDescription` for information‑transforming Methods. Physical Methods are equally valid (matter/energy transformations). A “universal transformer” is a system that can enact **any physically admissible MethodDescription**; this does **not** collapse Method into “algorithm.”


### A.3.1:9 - Method mereology (composition) — design‑time only

**Operators (conceptual, context‑scoped):**

* **Serial composition (`-`)** — do A then B → `A - B` is a new Method.
* **Parallel composition (`‖`)** — do A and B concurrently (with declared independence/joins).
* **Choice (`|`)** — do **one** of {A, B} under guard/selector.
* **Iteration (`*`)** — repeat A under a loop invariant/termination condition.
* **Refinement (`≤ₘ`)** — Method M' preserves M’s interface/effects and **strengthens** preconditions or **tightens** non‑functional bounds (context‑defined lattice).
* **Substitution** — replace a Method factor with a semantically equivalent one (`M ≡ N` in context) without changing the whole’s Standard.

**Design‑time laws (intuitive, not mechanized here):**

* Associativity for `-` and, where admissible, for `‖`.
* Distributivity over guarded choice under context rules.
* Identity elements (e.g., `Skip` that preserves state and satisfies neutral bounds).
* Monotonicity: refinement of a factor **should not** break the whole’s postconditions.

**Run‑time mapping (do not conflate):**
`U.Work` instances of `A - B` **may** interleave differently due to scheduling or failure‑handling and still be executions of `A - B`. The mapping is “execution semantics,” not part of Method mereology.

### A.3.1:10 - How Methods interact with Roles, Capability, Work, Dynamics (manager’s view)

* **Roles (assignment).** Steps stipulate **role kinds** (e.g., `IncisionOperatorRole`), not people. At run time, `U.Work` references a **`U.RoleAssignment`** that satisfies the role kind.
* **Capability (ability).** Steps may require **thresholds** (e.g., “precision ≤ 0.2 mm”). They are checked against the **holder’s `U.Capability`** in the context/envelope.
* **Work (execution).** Each run records `isExecutionOf → MethodDescription` (the spec used) and `performedBy → RoleAssigning`. Logs, resources, and timestamps live here.
* **Dynamics (laws/models).** Methods may cite or assume a Dynamics model; runs may attach traces that are explained by that model. Do not label the model itself as the Method.


### A.3.1:11 - Anti‑patterns (and the right move)

* **Spec = Method.** “The BPMN is the Method.” → The BPMN is a **MethodDescription**; the **Method** is the semantic way it denotes.
* **Run = Method.** “Yesterday’s process is our Method.” → Yesterday’s run is **Work**.
* **Role leakage.** “Step 3 is done by Alice.” → Step 3 **requires** `SurgeonRole`; Alice may be assigned via **RoleAssigning**.
* **Schedule leakage.** “Run at 02:00 daily” inside the Method. → This belongs to **WorkPlan**; Methods are timeless.
* **BoM entanglement.** Putting parts/assemblies inside Method definition. → Structure stays in PBS/SBS; Method references **interfaces/resources**, not a BoM.
* **Algorithm‑only bias.** Declaring that only code counts as a Method. → Physical transformations (welding, mixing) are Methods too; their SOPs/parameters are MethodDescriptions.
* **Hard‑coding capability.** Baking “≤ 0.2 mm” into a role name or Method name. → Keep thresholds on **steps**; **capability** lives on the **holder**.


### A.3.1:12 - Migration notes (quick wins)

1. **Rename wisely.** Where texts say “process/method” but mean a diagram or code repo, label it **MethodDescription**; where they mean the abstract “how,” label it **Method**.
2. **Extract assignments.** Replace named people/units in specs with **role kinds**; enforce assignments via **RoleAssigning** at run time.
3. **Pull time out.** Move calendars/schedules from specs into **WorkPlan**.
4. **Parameter hygiene.** Declare parameters at Method/MethodDescription; bind values in **Work**.
5. **Equivalence notes.** When two specs are intended as the same Method, write an **equivalence note** in the context (pre/post/bounds parity).


### A.3.1:13 - Consequences

| Benefits                                                                                                                    | Trade‑offs / mitigations                                                                           |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Clarity across paradigms.** Methods are first‑class regardless of notation; teams stop arguing step‑vs‑functional.        | **One more name to learn.** Use the quick grammar card; it pays off fast.                          |
| **Reuse without personnel lock‑in.** assignment moves to RoleAssigning; Methods remain portable.                             | **Extra role tables.** Keep role‑kind lists short and context‑local.                               |
| **Robust audits.** Logs are Work, specs are MethodDescription, Standards are Method; no more “we thought the diagram was the run.” | **Discipline needed.** Enforce the three‑way split in reviews.                                     |
| **Constructor‑theoretic coherence.** Physical and informational transformations are peers.                                  | **Cultural shift.** Not every team is used to seeing SOPs and code as the same class (MethodDescription). |


### A.3.1:14 - Relations

* **Builds on:** A.1 Holonic Foundation; A.1.1 `U.BoundedContext`; A.2 `U.Role`; A.2.1 `U.RoleAssignment`; A.2.2 `U.Capability`.
* **Coordinates with:** A.3 (role masks for transformers/constructors/observers); A.15 (Role–Method–Work Alignment); B.1 Γ (aggregation) for method families vs assembly of systems.
* **Informs:** `U.WorkPlan` definitional pattern (plans reference Methods they schedule); `U.ServiceClause` definitional pattern (promises cite Methods as delivery means); `U.Dynamics` definitional pattern (models that Methods may assume).


### A.3.1:15 - Didactic quick cards (reuse in specs and onboarding)

* **Method / MethodDescription / Work** = *how in principle* / *how it is written* / *how it went this time*.
* **Four‑slot grammar:** Who? → **RoleAssigning**. Can? → **Capability**. How? → **Method** (via **MethodDescription**). Did? → **Work**.
* **Design‑time vs run‑time:** Composition of Methods ≠ composition of Work.
* **No steps required:** Functional, logical, and hybrid MethodDescriptions are first‑class.
* **Keep time and people out:** Schedules → **WorkPlan**; assignees → **RoleAssigning**.
