## A.15.2 - U.WorkPlan

### A.15.2:1 - Context (plain‑language motivation)

Operations live on **time**. Even with perfect roles, abilities, and methods, nothing ships unless we **decide when and by whom** concrete runs **should** happen, under what **constraints** and **budgets**. Teams need a first‑class concept for **plans and schedules** that does **not** get confused with:

* the **semantic “way of doing”** (that is `U.Method`),
* the **written recipe** (that is `U.MethodDescription`),
* the **actual execution** (that is `U.Work`), or
* the **state laws** (that is `U.Dynamics`).

`U.WorkPlan` is that missing anchor.


### A.15.2:2 - Problem (what breaks without `WorkPlan`)

1. **“Workflow = schedule” conflation.** Flowcharts or code are used as calendars; resource clashes and SLA misses follow.
2. **Plan/run blur.** Gantt bars or Kanban tickets are reported as if the work already happened; audits and costing degrade.
3. **Spec/time leakage.** People and calendars creep into MethodDescriptions; reuse and staffing agility collapse.
4. **No variance model.** Without planned baselines, deviations in time, cost, and quality cannot be explained or improved.
5. **Structure entanglement.** BoM and org charts get baked into “process” views; plans become brittle and unmaintainable.


### A.15.2:3 - Forces (what we must balance)

| Force                              | Tension we resolve                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Universality vs. domain idioms** | One plan concept that fits hospitals, fabs, data centers, and research labs—while honoring local terms. |
| **Commitment vs. flexibility**     | Plans must be firm enough to coordinate, yet easy to update as reality changes.                         |
| **Assignment vs. assignment**     | Plans may name intended performers; the actual assignment must still be checked at run time.           |
| **Budgets vs. actuals**            | Plans carry targets and reservations; only Work carries actual spend.                                   |
| **Decomposition vs. mapping**      | Plan tasks decompose conveniently; they do not force a shape on actual Work runs.                       |


### A.15.2:4 - Solution — the `U.WorkPlan` as the time‑bound intention to execute Work

#### A.15.2:4.1 - Definition

**`U.WorkPlan`** is an **`U.Episteme`** that **declares intended `U.Work` occurrences** over a horizon, with **planned windows**, **dependencies**, **intended performers** (as **role kinds** or **proposed RoleAssignings**), **resource budgets/reservations**, and **acceptance targets**—**within a `U.BoundedContext`**.

> **Strict distinction (memory aid):**
> **Method** = *how in principle*. **MethodDescription** = *how it is written*.
> **WorkPlan** = *when, by whom in intent, under which constraints*.
> **Work** = *how it went this time*.

#### A.15.2:4.2 - Plan Items (what a `WorkPlan` is made of)

A `U.WorkPlan` **contains Plan Items** (think: scheduled tasks/ops), each of which typically states:

1. **Target Method/Spec** — the **Method** to be enacted and the **MethodDescription** intended for enactment.
2. **Planned window** — e.g., earliest start/latest finish, timebox, recurrence (cron‑like), blackout periods.
3. **Role requirements** — **role kinds** required (not people), optional **proposed RoleAssigning(s)** if pre‑assignment is allowed in the context.
4. **Capability thresholds** — minimal abilities required of the performer (checked at run time).
5. **Resource budgets/reservations** — planned energy/materials/machine slots/money; reservations on assets.
6. **Dependencies** — precedence/overlap permissions; gates/approvals.
7. **Acceptance targets** — quality windows/SLA targets to be judged when Work completes.
8. **Location/asset constraints** — where the run is expected to take place.
9. **Links to Service promises** (if any) — external commitments that this plan aims to satisfy.

> **Didactic guardrail:** **No logs or actuals** belong in a WorkPlan; **no step logic** or solver internals either—that’s the Method/Spec.

#### A.15.2:4.3 - Clear distinctions (lexical sanity for “schedule/process/workflow”)

| If you say…                                 | In FPF it is…                                        | Why                                               |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| “The **schedule** for tomorrow’s surgeries” | **`U.WorkPlan`**                                     | Calendar of intended runs (who/when constraints). |
| “The **workflow** for appendectomy”         | **`U.MethodDescription`** (and `U.Method`)                  | Recipe and semantic way, not a calendar.          |
| “The **process** already ran at 10:00”      | **`U.Work`**                                         | A dated run with resources and outcomes.          |
| “The **thermodynamic process** path”        | **`U.Work`** (occurrence) + **`U.Dynamics`** (model) | A realized trajectory plus its model, not a plan. |
| “The **plan** assigns Dr. Lee”              | **WorkPlan** naming an **intended** RoleAssigning      | assignment is still validated at run time.       |
| “The **budget** for Shift‑B”                | **WorkPlan** (planned ledger)                        | Actual costs land on **Work**, not on the plan.   |

> **L‑SCHED (lexical rule).** In this document, words like **schedule**, **calendar**, **rota**, **Gantt**, **plan** point to **`U.WorkPlan`** unless explicitly redefined by a bounded context glossary.

#### A.15.2:4.4 - Plan mereology (composition of plans ≠ composition of methods or runs)

Keep three separations crystal‑clear:

* **Method composition** (design‑time semantics) → produces **new Methods**.
* **Work composition** (run‑time occurrences) → produces **parent/child runs** with overlaps/episodes.
* **Plan mereology** (epistemic structure) → organizes **Plan Items** for coordination (phases, sprints, shifts), with **precedence** and **resource reservations**.

**Common relations among Plan Items:**

* **`Precedes_pl` / `DependsOn_pl`** — start/finish constraints and gates.
* **`MayOverlap_pl` / `MutuallyExclusive_pl`** — allowed overlaps vs exclusive windows.
* **`Refines_pl`** — a child plan item tightens windows/budgets of a parent.
* **`Alternative_pl`** — planned alternatives (e.g., backup rig, backup team).

**Didactic rule:** A Plan Item **does not force** an identical Work shape; mapping is via **fulfilment** and **variance** (see §6).

#### A.15.2:4.5 - How `WorkPlan` meets `Work` (fulfilment & variance)

When reality happens, each `U.Work` may:

* **Fulfil** a Plan Item — link `plannedAs → PlanItem`.
* **Partially fulfil** — multiple Work instances share one Plan Item (e.g., split run), or one Work fulfils several Plan Items (e.g., consolidated batch).
* **Deviate** — execute with method/spec substitution, different window, different performer (still valid or policy‑exception).
* **Be unplanned** — Work with no Plan Item (emergency, ad‑hoc); must be labeled as such.

**Variance dimensions** the plan expects to report on:

* **Schedule variance (Δt):** early/late vs planned window.
* **Cost variance (Δc):** actual resource spend vs budget.
* **Scope variance:** different Method/Spec than planned (with justification).
* **Quality variance:** acceptance verdict vs target.
* **Assignment variance:** intended vs actual RoleAssigning.

> **Manager’s view:** A plan that cannot report variance is a calendar picture, not a management tool.


### A.15.2:5 - What a good `WorkPlan` states (review checklist)

Use this as a human‑readable checklist (not a rigid schema):

1. **Horizon & cadence** (e.g., “W36 surgeries, daily ETL”).
2. **Plan Items** with: target Method/Spec, planned windows, dependencies.
3. **Role requirements** (kinds) and **intended assignments** (optional, context‑lawful).
4. **Capability thresholds** and **safety envelopes**.
5. **Resource budgets** and **reservations** on assets.
6. **Acceptance targets** (SLA/quality windows).
7. **Bridges** if plan spans **multiple contexts** (operations ↔ audit/regulatory).
8. **Baseline/version** and **change notes** (so variance is attributable).
9. **Policy pointers** (episode policy, overlap policy for Work roll‑ups if needed for KPIs).
10. **Exceptions path** (how ad‑hoc/emergency work is planned post‑factum).


### A.15.2:6 - Archetypal grounding (parallel domains)

#### A.15.2:6.1 - Hospital OR day plan (shift rota + cases)

* **WorkPlan:** `OR_DayPlan_2025‑08‑12`.
* **Plan Items:** `Case#1 Appendectomy`, `Case#2 Hernia`, with windows, Context assignments, and surgeon **role kinds**; anesthetist **intended RoleAssigning** provided.
* **Budgets:** OR time blocks, consumables envelopes.
* **Fulfilment:** Each surgery Work links to its Plan Item; variances computed (over‑run time, substitutions).

#### A.15.2:6.2 - Fab maintenance weekend (asset reservations)

* **WorkPlan:** `Fab_Maintenance_W36`.
* **Plan Items:** `Tool_42 chamber clean`, `Tool_13 calibration`; **MutuallyExclusive\_pl** with production slots.
* **Reservations:** nitrogen, DI water, metrology window.
* **Fulfilment:** Actual clean Work happens earlier; variance logged as **early** with cost underrun.

#### A.15.2:6.3 - Data‑center rollout (multi‑context plan)

* **WorkPlan:** `DC_Rollout_Phase‑2`.
* **Bridges:** Ops context ↔ Security Audit context (different acceptance targets).
* **Plan Items:** `Deploy Service A`, `Pen‑test A`; dependencies across contexts.
* **Fulfilment:** Deployment Work passes ops targets; audit Work passes later—variance reported per context.


### A.15.2:7 - Bias‑Annotation (as in E‑cluster)

* **Lenses tested:** `Did`, `Prag`, `Arch`, `Epist`.
* **Scope declaration:** Universal; meanings of windows/budgets/permissions are **context‑local** via `U.BoundedContext`.
* **Rationale:** Elevates **planning/scheduling** to a first‑class episteme that coordinates Methods, RoleAssignings, and Work without conflation.
