## A.3.2 - U.MethodDescription

### A.3.2:1 - Context (plain‑language motivation)

Projects need a **stable way to express “how it is written”**—the recipe, code, SOP, rule set, or formal proof—**without confusing it** with:

* the **semantic “way of doing”** (that is `U.Method`),
* the **assignment** (that is `U.RoleAssignment`),
* the **ability** (that is `U.Capability`),
* the **execution** (that is `U.Work`), or
* the **calendar plan** (that is `U.WorkPlan`).

`U.MethodDescription` gives this anchor. It treats **algorithms, programs, proofs, SOPs, BPMN diagrams, solver models, playbooks** as **one class of epistemes**: *knowledge on a carrier that describes a Method*. This unifies software and “paper” procedures and lets teams switch notations without breaking the model.


### A.3.2:2 - Problem (what breaks without a clear `MethodDescription`)

1. **Spec/run conflation.** A flowchart or code is mistaken for the run; audits and SLOs become unreliable.
2. **Who/time leakage.** People and calendars creep into the recipe; reuse and staffing agility die.
3. **Step‑only bias.** Functional or logical styles are treated as “not real methods”; designs get contorted into faux steps.
4. **Algorithm‑centrism.** Only code is considered “the method”, leaving SOPs and scientific procedures second‑class.
5. **Structure entanglement.** BoM/PBS elements end up inside the recipe; method and product structure tangle.
6. **Unstated equivalence.** Two specs intended to mean “the same method” are not declared equivalent; teams fork semantics by accident.


### A.3.2:3 - Forces (what we must balance)

| Force                              | Tension we resolve                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Representation vs. semantics**   | Many notations, one meaning: specs may differ, method stays one.                                    |
| **Universality vs. domain idioms** | SOPs, code, solver models, proofs—all first‑class, yet domain terms remain local.                   |
| **Timelessness vs. operability**   | Specs are timeless, but must be precise enough to drive execution and audit.                        |
| **Reusability vs. constraints**    | Specs should declare role kinds, capabilities, safety bounds—without baking in people or calendars. |
| **Evolvability vs. identity**      | Specs change; we need a way to evolve them without losing the method’s identity or history.         |


### A.3.2:4 - Solution — the specification as an episteme describing a Method

#### A.3.2:4.1 - Definition

**`U.MethodDescription`** is an **`U.Episteme`** that **describes a `U.Method`** in a concrete representation (text, code, diagram, model). It is **knowledge on a carrier** that can be reviewed and validated; at run-time a **`U.System`** **uses it to execute the `U.Method` as `U.Work` under a `U.RoleAssignment`**.

> **Strict Distinction (memory aid):**
> **Method** = *how in principle* (semantic Standard).
> **MethodDescription** = *how it is written* (artifact/description).
> **Work** = *how it went this time* (dated execution).

#### A.3.2:4.2 - Representation‑agnostic stance (independent of “algorithmic paradigm”)

`U.MethodDescription` **does not privilege any single notation**. Typical forms include (non‑exhaustive):

* **Imperative Spec** — SOP, BPMN/flowchart, PLC ladder, shell/pipeline scripts.
* **Functional Spec** — compositions of pure functions, typed pipelines, category‑style combinators.
* **Logical/Constraint Spec** — rules/goal sets, SAT/SMT/MILP models, theorem‑prover scripts.
* **Statistical/ML Spec** — model definitions, training/evaluation procedures, inference pipelines.
* **Reactive/Event‑driven Spec** — statecharts, observers/triggers, stream/CEP rules.
* **Hybrid Spec** — mixtures (e.g., imperative orchestration calling solver kernels).

**Same Method, different MethodDescriptions.** In a single `U.BoundedContext`, several MethodDescriptions **may describe the same `U.Method`** if they entail the **same preconditions**, **guarantee the same effects**, and meet the **same non‑functional bounds** (cf. A.3.1).

#### A.3.2:4.3 - What a good MethodDescription states (paradigm‑neutral content)

Not a schema—these are **content prompts** for reviewers:

1. **Purpose & Name of the Method** it describes (link to `U.Method`).
2. **Interface/ports** (inputs/outputs/resources/Standards) in the context’s vocabulary.
3. **Preconditions** (guards, invariants, required states).
4. **Postconditions / Effects** (what is guaranteed upon success).
5. **Non‑functional constraints** (latency, precision, cost, safety envelope).
6. **Role requirements** for enactment (**kinds**, not people)—to be satisfied at run time via **`U.RoleAssignment`**.
7. **Capability thresholds** the performer must meet (checked against **`U.Capability`** of the holder).
8. **Failure semantics** (detectable failures, compensations, rollback/forward strategies).
9. **Compositional hooks** (how this spec composes: serial/parallel/choice/iteration), without embedding calendars.
10. **Parameter declarations** (what may vary per run; values bound at `U.Work` creation).

> **Didactic guardrail:** A MethodDescription **does not** embed a schedule, assignees, or BoM. Calendars → `U.WorkPlan`; people/units → `U.RoleAssignment`; product structure → PBS/SBS.

#### A.3.2:4.4 - Epistemic roles for MethodDescriptions (via `U.RoleAssignment`)

Being an Episteme, a MethodDescription may itself play epistemic roles via `U.RoleAssignment` in a context (classification, not action), e.g.:

* `ApprovedProcedureRole`, `RegulatedProcedureRole`, `SafetyCriticalProcedureRole`, `De‑factoStandardRole`.
* These **do not** make the spec an actor; they classify its **status** within the context (who may use it, in which settings).

#### A.3.2:4.5 - Constructor‑theoretic note (unifying “algorithms” and “physical recipes”)

In the constructor‑theoretic reading used by FPF:

* **Algorithms, programs, solver models, proofs** are all **`U.MethodDescription`**—descriptions of Methods that transform **information**.
* **SOPs, control recipes, lab protocols** are **`U.MethodDescription`**—descriptions of Methods that transform **matter/energy**.
* A **universal transformer** (a system with sufficient capability) enacts **any physically admissible MethodDescription**—not only informational ones.

This keeps software and “wet lab” on equal footing.


### A.3.2:5 - Clear distinctions (quick litmus for managers)

| You are holding…                          | It is…                         | Why                                           |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| A BPMN diagram or SOP                     | **`U.MethodDescription`**             | A description on a carrier.                   |
| A git repo or compiled binary             | **`U.MethodDescription`**             | Still a description (even if executable).     |
| “The way we do X in principle”            | **`U.Method`**                 | Semantic Standard beyond any single notation. |
| A run log with timestamps                 | **`U.Work`**                   | A dated execution event.                      |
| A role description (“surgeon”, “planner”) | **`U.Role` / `U.RoleAssignment`** | assignment, not recipe.                      |
| “Can achieve ±0.2 mm”                     | **`U.Capability`**             | Ability of a holder, not a spec.              |
| A calendar for next week’s runs           | **`U.WorkPlan`**               | Plan/schedule, not a recipe.                  |
| A state‑transition law                    | **`U.Dynamics`**               | Model of evolution, not a method description. |


### A.3.2:6 - Archetypal grounding (parallel cases)

#### A.3.2:6.1 - Industrial SOP (imperative)

* **Method:** `Etch_Al2O3`.
* **MethodDescription:** `SOP_Etch_v7.pdf` + PLC ladder file.
* **Role requirements:** `EtchOperatorRole`; **Capability:** gas‑control precision ≤ threshold.
* **Execution:** `Tool_42#TransformerRole:Fab_A` enacts the spec → **Work** runs W‑143…W‑155.

#### A.3.2:6.2 - Optimization model (logical/constraint)

* **Method:** `JS_Schedule_v4`.
* **MethodDescription:** MILP model + solver config; admissible solution definition.
* **Execution:** `PlannerService_v4#TransformerRole:Plant_2025` produces **Work** `Run_2025‑W32‑P1`.

#### A.3.2:6.3 - Clinical guideline (epistemic, status via RoleStateGraph + State Assertion)

* **Method:** `AcuteAppendicitis_Triage`.
* **MethodDescription:** clinical decision rule set; **Epistemic Role**: `RegulatedProcedureRole:Hospital_Context`.
* **Execution:** `ER_Team#TransformerRole:ER_Shift` enacts the spec on a case → **Work** visit V‑8842.


### A.3.2:7 - Bias‑Annotation (as in E‑cluster)

* **Lenses tested:** `Did`, `Prag`, `Arch`, `Epist`.
* **Scope declaration:** Universal; semantics are **context‑local** via `U.BoundedContext`.
* **Rationale:** Elevates **all** procedural artifacts—code, SOPs, proofs, models—to a single class, avoiding algorithm‑centrism and step‑only bias. Keeps the strict split among **Method / MethodDescription / Work / Role / Capability**.

### A.3.2:8 - Conformance Checklist (normative)

**CC‑A3.2‑1 (Episteme status).**
`U.MethodDescription` **IS** an `U.Episteme` (knowledge on a carrier). It is **not** a `U.Method` (semantic way), **not** a `U.Work` (execution), **not** a `U.Role/RoleAssigning` (assignment), **not** a `U.WorkPlan` (schedule), and **not** PBS/SBS content.

**CC‑A3.2‑2 (Context anchoring).**
Every `U.MethodDescription` **MUST** be interpreted **within** a `U.BoundedContext`. Names, Standards, and admissible non‑functional bounds are **local** to that context.

**CC‑A3.2‑3 (Method linkage).**
A `U.MethodDescription` **MUST** declare the `U.Method` it describes. Multiple MethodDescriptions **MAY** describe the same Method (see CC‑A3.2‑8).

**CC‑A3.2‑4 (assignment/time‑free).**
A MethodDescription **SHALL NOT** embed assignees, org units, or calendars. People/units are bound via **`U.RoleAssignment`** at run time; calendars belong to **`U.WorkPlan`**.

**CC‑A3.2‑5 (Structure‑free).**
BoM/PBS/SBS artifacts **SHALL NOT** be embedded in MethodDescriptions. Reference **interfaces/resources** and constraints instead of listing parts/assemblies.

**CC‑A3.2‑6 (Role and capability requirements).**
A MethodDescription **MAY** state **role kinds** and **capability thresholds** required for enactment. These are **requirements**, not bindings. They are checked at run time against `U.RoleAssignment` and `U.Capability`.

**CC‑A3.2‑7 (Parameterization).**
Parameters **MUST** be **declared** in the Method/MethodDescription; concrete values are **bound** when creating `U.Work`. Default values in a spec are allowed but **SHALL NOT** force a schedule or assignee.

**CC‑A3.2‑8 (Semantic equivalence).**
Two MethodDescriptions **describe the same `U.Method`** in a given context **iff** they entail the **same preconditions**, **guarantee the same postconditions/effects**, and satisfy the **same non‑functional bounds** for all admissible inputs/conditions of that context (per A.3.1 CC‑A3.1‑7). Differences in control flow, search, or notation do **not** break equivalence.

**CC‑A3.2‑9 (Refinement).**
`Spec₂` **refines** `Spec₁` for the same Method iff it **preserves interface**, **does not weaken** postconditions/effects, and **tightens** (or equal) non‑functional bounds under **equal or stronger** preconditions. Declare refinement explicitly in the context.

**CC‑A3.2‑10 (Compatibility claims).**
Claims such as “sound but incomplete” or “complete but potentially unsound” relative to another MethodDescription **MUST** be stated explicitly and scoped to the context (e.g., solver approximations).

**CC‑A3.2‑11 (Executable specs).**
Executability does **not** change status: an executable artifact (program, script) is still a **MethodDescription**. Its runs are **Work**; its semantics are the **Method** it denotes.

**CC‑A3.2‑12 (Epistemic roles via `U.RoleAssignment`).**
A MethodDescription **MAY** play **epistemic roles** via `U.RoleAssignment` (e.g., `ApprovedProcedureRole`, `RegulatedProcedureRole`) that classify its status. Such bindings **do not** make the spec an actor.

**CC‑A3.2‑13 (Non‑determinism declaration).**
If a MethodDescription permits non‑determinism (e.g., search/optimization), the **space of admissible outcomes** and **acceptance criteria** **MUST** be stated (so that Work can be judged).

**CC‑A3.2‑14 (Bridging across contexts).**
If two contexts use different MethodDescriptions for “the same‑named way,” an explicit **Bridge (`U.Alignment`)** **SHOULD** be provided to map terms/assumptions. Do **not** assume cross‑context identity by name alone.


### A.3.2:9 - MethodDescription mereology (epistemic composition; not method composition)

Keep two worlds separate:

* **Method composition (design‑time semantic):** combines Methods into **new Methods** (A.3.1 §9).
* **MethodDescription mereology (epistemic):** combines **documents/code/models** into larger **spec artifacts**. This is about **parts of the description**, not about the semantic method algebra.

**Epistemic part relations (illustrative):**

* **`ConstituentOf`** — a chapter/module/snippet is a constituent of a larger spec.
* **`Imports/Uses`** — this spec reuses a library/rule set.
* **`VariantOf`** — this spec is a variant (e.g., for different equipment) with declared deltas.
* **`RepresentationOf`** — this visual diagram is a representation of the textual rule set.

**Didactic rule:** Do not infer that a spec with two modules **means** a Method with “two steps.” Modules are **parts of the description**, not necessarily steps of the Method.


### A.3.2:10 - Parameterization & variability (templates, defaults, configs)

**Templates.** A MethodDescription may serve as a **template** with parameters (e.g., temperature set‑points, solver tolerances, objective weights).

**Binding time.**

* **Declare** parameters in the spec;
* **Bind** values when creating `U.Work` (or at an agreed “compile” stage);
* Keep bound values **visible** in the Work record (so runs can be compared).

**Defaults and guards.**

* Defaults are allowed; list **valid ranges** and **guards** (e.g., safety constraints).
* If a default has safety impact, state it explicitly as part of **preconditions**.

**Variants.**

* When variants differ only by **parameter ranges** → keep one Method with one MethodDescription template.
* When variants differ by **Standard** (effects/bounds) → either declare a **refinement** or introduce a **distinct Method** (context decision).


### A.3.2:11 - Equivalence & compatibility (across notations and contexts)

**Within one context.**

* Use **semantic equivalence** (CC‑A3.2‑8) to assert that BPMN vs code vs solver model are the **same Method**.
* Prefer a short **equivalence note** showing parity of pre/post/bounds.

**Across contexts.**

* Treat identity as **not guaranteed**.
* Provide **Bridges (`U.Alignment`)** that map terms, units, roles, and acceptance criteria.
* Be explicit if one spec is only **sound** (never returns forbidden outcomes) vs **complete** (can return all allowed outcomes).

**Observational perspective (pragmatic).**
Two specs are observationally equivalent for stakeholders **if**, under declared conditions, they are indistinguishable by the acceptance tests of that context (even if internal strategies differ).


### A.3.2:12 - Anti‑patterns (and the right move)

* **Spec = run.** “Yesterday’s process log is our spec.” → The log is **Work**; write a **MethodDescription** and link runs to it.
* **Who/time in the spec.** “Step 3 by Alice at 02:00 daily.” → Use **RoleAssigning** at run time; schedule via **WorkPlan**.
* **Stuffing BoM.** Listing parts/assemblies inside the spec. → Reference **interfaces/resources**; keep PBS/SBS separate.
* **Algorithm‑only bias.** Treating code as “real spec” and SOPs as “notes.” → Both are **MethodDescription**; judge by Standards, not by format.
* **Hiding non‑determinism.** Solver model with no acceptance criteria. → Declare admissible outcome set and tests.
* **Silent parameter capture.** Hard‑coding values without declaring parameters. → Declare parameters with ranges; bind at Work creation.
* **Undeclared variant drift.** Copy‑pasting specs and tweaking silently. → Use **VariantOf** with stated deltas or declare a refinement.


### A.3.2:13 - Migration notes (quick wins)

1. **Label the artifacts.** Wherever a repo/diagram/document “is the process,” rename it **MethodDescription** and link it to a named **Method**.
2. **Extract people and calendars.** Move all assignees to **RoleAssigning** and all schedules to **WorkPlan**.
3. **Introduce parameter blocks.** Add a small “Parameters” section with ranges/defaults and safety guards.
4. **Write acceptance criteria.** Especially for search/optimization or ML specs.
5. **Declare equivalence/refinement.** Where two notations intend “the same way,” add an **equivalence note**; where the new one tightens bounds, declare **refinement**.
6. **Bridge domains.** If two departments use different vocabularies, add a **Bridge (`U.Alignment`)** rather than forcing a single spec.


### A.3.2:14 - Consequences

| Benefits                                                                                                          | Trade‑offs / mitigations                                                                           |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **One class for all recipes.** SOPs, code, models, proofs become peers; teams can choose the best notation.       | **A bit more ceremony.** You name the Method and the MethodDescription separately; the payoff is clarity. |
| **Cleaner audits.** Specs vs runs vs assignments vs abilities never mix.                                         | **Discipline required.** Keep schedules and people out of specs.                                   |
| **Easier reuse and substitution.** Equivalence/refinement rules enable swapping notations without semantic drift. | **Equivalence is a claim.** Back it with short acceptance tests.                                   |
| **Cross‑domain coherence.** Bridges allow controlled translation between contexts.                                | **Bridge maintenance.** Someone owns the mapping; keep it short and focused.                       |


### A.3.2:15 - Relations

* **Builds on:** A.3.1 `U.Method` (the semantic way it describes); A.1.1 `U.BoundedContext`.
* **Coordinates with:** A.2 `U.Role`, A.2.1 `U.RoleAssignment` (who enacts it); A.2.2 `U.Capability` (ability thresholds); A.15 Role–Method–Work (linking `isExecutionOf` to runs).
* **Informs:** `U.WorkPlan` (plans reference MethodDescriptions); `U.Dynamics` (models that specs may assume); Epistemic Role patterns (status of specs RoleStateGraph + State Assertion).
* **Lexical guards:** E.10.y **L‑PROC** (do not call MethodDescription “process” when you mean Work/WorkPlan); E.10.x **L‑FUNC** (avoid “function/functionality” confusion).


### A.3.2:16 - Didactic quick cards

* **Spec ≠ Method ≠ Work.** *Written recipe* ≠ *semantic way* ≠ *dated execution*.
* **Keep people/time out.** Assignees → **RoleAssigning**; schedules → **WorkPlan**.
* **Declare parameters & acceptance.** Bind values at Work; state how success is judged.
* **Same method, different specs.** BPMN/code/solver can be equivalent **if** pre/post/bounds match.
* **Bridge, do not blur.** Cross‑team/domain differences go through **`U.Alignment`**, not wishful thinking.
  
### A.3.2:End
