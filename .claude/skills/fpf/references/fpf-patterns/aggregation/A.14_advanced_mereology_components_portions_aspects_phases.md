## A.14 - Advanced Mereology: Components, Portions, Aspects & Phases

### A.14:1 - Context — why an advanced mereology?

FPF’s holonic world is built from **part–whole** relations. Early drafts distinguished structural vs. conceptual parthood (e.g., **ComponentOf**, **ConstituentOf**) but practical modelling kept hitting two recurrent gaps:

1. **Quantities vs. parts.** Engineers routinely need “some of the fuel”, “the first 10 pages”, “a 30% subset of data”. This is not a component; it is a **portion** of a stuff‑like whole, governed by measures and conservation.

2. **Change vs. replacement.** Authors need to say “the prototype **before calibration**”, “v2 of the spec”, “shift 1 vs. shift 2 of the same run”. That is not a new whole; it is a **phase** of the same carrier across time.

This section introduces two **normative** sub‑relations of `partOf` that close those gaps and lock them to the rest of the kernel:

* **PortionOf** — metrical, measure‑preserving parthood of stuffs and other measurables.
* **PhaseOf** — temporal parthood of the *same* carrier across an interval.

It also restates guard‑rails that keep **roles** and **recipes** outside mereology (A.15), and clarifies how **MemberOf** fits (preview: **collections** are grounded constructively in **C.13 Compose‑CAL** via `Γ_m.set`; **collective agency** is handled outside mereology in **A.15 Role–Method–Work**).

**Publication note (Working‑Model first).** Read A.14 together with **E.14 Human‑Centric Working‑Model** and **B.3.5 CT2R‑LOG**: publish relations on the **Working‑Model** surface; when assurance is sought, **ground downward**. For structural claims that require extensional identity, use the **Constructive** shoulder via **Compose‑CAL Γ_m (sum | set | slice)**; order/time stay outside mereology (Γ_time / Γ_method).

### A.14:2 - Problem — what breaks without these distinctions?

If we only have “generic partOf” (plus Component/Constituent), four classes of errors appear:

1. **Conservation errors.** Treating “20 L of fuel from Tank A” as a component leads to nonsense: adding and removing such “components” does not respect quantities; Γ\_sys proofs violate Σ‑balance.

2. **Temporal smearing.** Flattening “before/after”, or “v1/v2” into one timeless whole collapses history; Γ\_time and Γ\_method cannot justify order‑sensitive properties; audits cannot reproduce conditions.

3. **Identity confusion.** Modelling “new version” as “new component” either breaks identity (it is still the *same* holon evolving) or hides a **Meta‑Holon Transition** when identity really changes.

4. **Role leakage.** Functional/organisational roles sneak into part trees (“the PumpRole is part of the plant”), violating A.15 and making structural reasoning brittle.


### A.14:3 - Forces

| Force                              | Tension                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Expressiveness vs. Parsimony**   | We need new relations (Portion, Phase) ↔ we must keep the catalogue minimal and orthogonal.                     |
| **Universality vs. Domain nuance** | One set of rules must serve physical systems and epistemes ↔ measurement and time behave differently by domain. |
| **Identity vs. Change**            | Preserve “the same carrier through change” ↔ allow explicit re‑identification when invariants fail.             |
| **Static structure vs. Histories** | Part trees should be simple ↔ real work requires phased histories and measured slices.                          |

### A.14:4 - Solution — extend the mereology catalogue, keep it clean

**A.14 defines two additional sub‑relations of `partOf`** and **re‑affirms the firewall** between mereology and the role/recipe layer:

1. **PortionOf** — for *measured* parts of a whole (stuffs and other extensives).
2. **PhaseOf** — for *temporal* parts of the same carrier.
3. **No roles/recipes in mereology.** `U.Role`, `U.Method`, `U.MethodDescription` are **never** parts (A.15).
4. **MemberOf stays, but constructive aggregation and agency live elsewhere.** `MemberOf` remains available to state collections and collectives; **their collection‑as‑whole may be constructed via Γ\_m.set (Compose‑CAL, C.13)**, while **composition and agency are handled in B.1.7 Γ\_collective** (not in A.14).

The classical pair **ComponentOf** (structural, discrete) and **ConstituentOf** (conceptual, logical/epistemic) remain as in the kernel; A.14 only clarifies **how to tell them apart from Portion/Phase** (§ 6).

### A.14:5 - Formal cores (normative semantics)

#### A.14:5.1 - PortionOf — metrical part of a measurable whole

**Intent.** Capture “some of the same stuff/extent”, governed by a measure that adds up.

**Applicability.** Any `U.Holon` that carries an **extensive** measure μ on the chosen scope
(examples: mass, volume, length‑of‑text, byte size, wall‑time budget).

**Primitive.** `PortionOf(x, y)` means: *x is the same kind of stuff/content as y, but less*.

**Axioms (A14‑POR‑\*)**

* **POR‑1 (Partial order).** PortionOf is reflexive, antisymmetric, transitive on its domain.
* **POR‑2 (Metrical dominance).** If `x ProperPortionOf y` then `0 < μ(x) < μ(y)` for the agreed μ.
* **POR‑3 (Additivity on disjoint portions).** If `x ⟂ y` (no overlap) and both PortionOf y, then `μ(x ⊔ y) = μ(x)+μ(y)` and `x ⊔ y PortionOf y`.
* **POR‑4 (Kind integrity).** x and y must share the same **measure kind** and **unit** (or a declared conversion).
* **POR‑5 (Boundary compatibility).** For physical wholes, the whole’s boundary encloses the union of its portions; cross‑boundary “leaks” are interactions, not portions.

**Didactic tests.**
✔ “5 kg from a 20 kg billet” — PortionOf.
✔ “Pages 1–10 of the report” — PortionOf (μ = page or token count).
✘ “The pump module of the plant” — **ComponentOf**, not PortionOf.
✘ “The Methods section of the paper” — **ConstituentOf**, not PortionOf.


#### A.14:5.2 - PhaseOf — temporal part of the same carrier

**Intent.** Capture “the same holon during a sub‑interval”, preserving identity through change.

**Applicability.** Any `U.Holon` that persists across time with a recognised **carrier identity**.

**Primitive.** `PhaseOf(x, y)` means: *x is y restricted to a proper time interval*.

**Axioms (A14‑PHA‑\*)**

* **PHA‑1 (Partial order).** PhaseOf is reflexive, antisymmetric, transitive (on the same carrier).
* **PHA‑2 (Coverage).** The whole is the union of its maximal, non‑overlapping phases over its lifetime interval.
* **PHA‑3 (No paradoxical overlap).** Phases of the **same carrier** do not overlap in time; overlapping variants require `PhaseOf` on *aspects* or different carriers.
* **PHA‑4 (Identity through change).** Properties may vary between phases, but the carrier’s identity criteria hold continuously (e.g., same serial number, same legal identity, same theorem statement).
* **PHA‑5 (Escalation to MHT).** If identity criteria break (e.g., metamorphosis with new objectives), **declare a Meta‑Holon Transition (B.2)** rather than a PhaseOf.

**Didactic tests.**
✔ “PumpUnit\#3 **before** calibration” — PhaseOf(Pump\#3\_pre, Pump\#3).
✔ “Spec v2” — PhaseOf(Spec\_v2, Spec), on the **MethodDescription** artefact.
✔ “Shift 1 of the same batch run” — PhaseOf(Work\_shift1, Work).
✘ “Prototype vs. production unit” — likely **different carriers**; use ComponentOf/ConstituentOf or MHT per criteria.

#### A.14:5.3 - CT2R‑LOG & Compose‑CAL handshake *(normative link)*

* **Structural claims** published on the Working-Model surface **SHALL** be justified, when assurance is required, by a **Constructive** grounding narrative using **Γ_m.sum | Γ_m.set | Γ_m.slice** and **linked with `tv:groundedBy`** (see **B.3.5**; **C.13**).  
* **PhaseOf** is **temporal parthood**; it **SHALL NOT** be grounded via Γ\_m. Its assurance follows identity‑through‑time criteria (CC‑PHA‑1..3) and Γ\_time ordering (B.1.4).  
* **MemberOf** remains **non‑mereological** (CC‑MEM‑2). When modelling a collection‑as‑whole for assurance purposes, the constructive basis is **Γ\_m.set**; no **ComponentOf** inferences follow from **MemberOf**.

### A.14:6 - Choosing the right relation (decision table)

| You want to say…                                             | Use                  | Why                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| “This is a *piece* of the same stuff (lower amount/extent).” | **PortionOf**        | Governed by a measure μ and conservation (Σ‑additive).                             |
| “This is a *discrete part* that sits *inside* the whole.”    | **ComponentOf**      | Structural parthood; boundary‑respecting, not measured by μ.                       |
| “This is a *logical part* in a conceptual whole.”            | **ConstituentOf**    | Sections, lemmas, clauses, conceptual assembly.                                    |
| “This is the *same thing* during a *sub‑interval*.”          | **PhaseOf**          | Temporal slicing with identity continuity.                                         |
| “This *item belongs to that collection/collective*.”         | **MemberOf**         | Not a building block of the whole; composition handled in **B.1.7 Γ\_collective**. |
| “This system *plays a Role or position*.”          | **playsRole** (A.15) | Roles are contextual masks, never parts.                                           |

> **Firewall reminder.** If your sentence contains “role”, “policy”, “process/workflow/SOP/script”, you are likely talking about **A.15** (roles/recipes/runs), **not** A.14.


### A.14:7 - Archetypal grounding (System / Episteme)

| Relation                       | `U.System` example                                     | `U.Episteme` example                                        |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **PortionOf**                  | 50 L from a 200 L fuel tank (μ = volume).              | Pages 1–10 from a 120‑page report (μ = page/token count).   |
| **ComponentOf**                | Impeller **ComponentOf** PumpUnit.                     | Figure 2 **ComponentOf** Poster Layout (physical artefact). |
| **ConstituentOf**              | Control law **ConstituentOf** Controller Design.       | Lemma A **ConstituentOf** Theorem Proof.                    |
| **PhaseOf**                    | PumpUnit\#3 *before*/*after* calibration (same serial). | Spec v1 → v2 (same document lineage).                       |
| MemberOf (for reference) | “is an element of a collection/collective”; use when a grouping is explicitly treated as a whole set, without implying component integration. Not a building block of the whole; **constructive aggregation** is handled in **C.13 Compose‑CAL** (`Γ_m.set`). If the grouping is expected to **act**, model a **collective system** (A.15). |

### A.14:8 - Conformance Checklist & type guards (normative)

#### A.14:8.1 - Global firewall and scope

| ID            | Requirement                                                                                 | Purpose                                                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CC‑A14‑0**  | No `U.Role`, `U.Method`, or `U.MethodDescription` **MAY** occur as a node in any `partOf` chain.   | Keeps parthood purely structural/conceptual (see A.15). |
| **CC‑A14‑0b** | `MemberOf` **MUST NOT** imply, entail, or be auto‑rewritten into any `partOf` sub‑relation. | Separates collections/collectives from parthood.        |
| **CC‑A14‑0c** | `SerialStepOf` / `ParallelFactorOf` **MUST NOT** appear in any `partOf` chain or table in A.14; model order via **A.15** (**Γ_ctx/Γ_method**). | Prevents the “order‑as‑structure” category error.       |

#### A.14:8.2 - PortionOf guards

| ID                                 | Requirement                                                                                                                                                               | Purpose                                 |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **CC‑POR‑1 (Domain)**              | `PortionOf(x,y)` is valid only if the modelling scope declares at least one **extensive measure** μ for y (mass, volume, token count, byte size, wall‑time budget, etc.). | Prevents “portion” without a measure.   |
| **CC‑POR‑2 (Kind)**                | x and y **SHALL** share the same μ‑kind and compatible units (or an explicit conversion).                                                                                 | Prevents apples‑to‑oranges addition.    |
| **CC‑POR‑3 (Monotone additivity)** | For disjoint portions `x ⟂ z` with `PortionOf(-,y)`: μ(x ⊔ z) = μ(x)+μ(z).                                                                                                | Secures Σ‑reasoning and Γ\_sys proofs. |
| **CC‑POR‑4 (Boundary)**            | For physical systems, the whole’s boundary encloses the union of portions; cross‑boundary flows are **not** portions.                                                     | Distinguishes stock vs flow.            |
| **CC‑POR‑5 (Non‑replacement)**     | “Replacing 20% of y by v” **MUST** be modelled as **PortionOf** removal + **Component/Constituent** insertion, not as a single PortionOf rewrite.                         | Avoids silent identity change.          |

#### A.14:8.3 - PhaseOf guards

| ID                                    | Requirement                                                                                                                                                      | Purpose                                |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **CC‑PHA‑1 (Carrier identity)**       | `PhaseOf(x,y)` requires an explicit **identity criterion** for y valid over the union of phases (e.g., serial number, legal identity, theorem statement).        | Prevents re‑identification by stealth. |
| **CC‑PHA‑2 (Coverage & non‑overlap)** | The lifetime of y equals the union of its maximal, non‑overlapping phases (on the same aspect).                                                                  | Enables Γ\_time composition and audit. |
| **CC‑PHA‑3 (Aspect clarity)**         | If two temporal slices of y overlap, they **MUST** be phases of **different aspects** (e.g., mechanical‑state vs software‑state), or else be different carriers. | Avoids paradoxical overlaps.           |
| **CC‑PHA‑4 (Escalation)**             | If identity criteria fail during change, declare a **Meta‑Holon Transition** (B.2) instead of PhaseOf.                                                           | Makes re‑identification explicit.      |
| **CC‑PHA‑5 (MethodDescription & Work)**      | Versions of **MethodDescription** and slices of **Work** **SHALL** use `PhaseOf` (A.15); PhaseOf never applies to `U.Role`.                                             | Aligns with A.15 bindings.             |

#### A.14:8.4 - Anchoring & validation (normative)

| ID              | Requirement                                                                                                      | Purpose                                           |
| ----------------| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **CC‑ANCH‑1**   | Every `ut:StructPartOf` edge **MUST** carry a `tv:groundedBy` link to a valid `Γ_m` constructor trace (Compose‑CAL). | Makes A.10 executable; ensures extensional identity. |
| **CC-ANCH-2**   | For **epistemic** edges (`ut:EpiPartOf` and its sub-types), `tv:groundedBy` is **OPTIONAL**; instead supply **`ev:evidence`** and set **`validationMode ∈ {axiomatic, postulate, inferential}`**. | Harmonises evidence treatment for epistemic edges. |
| **CC‑ANCH‑3**   | The public query Standard remains `?x ut:PartOf+ ?y`; internally it is realised via CT2R‑aliases grounded by `Γ_m` traces. | Preserves the “one query” UX while tightening semantics. |

*Note.* Property names and trace semantics are defined in the CT2R‑LOG / Compose‑CAL.

#### A.14:8.5 - MemberOf minimal semantics (non‑mereological)

| ID           | Requirement                                                                                       | Purpose                               |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **CC‑MEM‑1** | `MemberOf` domain/range are open: any `U.Holon` may be a member of a collection/collective holon. | Allows mixed collections when needed. |
| **CC‑MEM‑2** | From `MemberOf(x,C)` it is **forbidden** to infer any property of C to x via parthood rules.      | Prevents “set‑as‑whole” errors.       |
| **CC‑MEM‑3** | **Constructive aggregation of collections** is provided by **C.13 Compose‑CAL** (`Γ_m.set`); **agency of collectives** is specified outside A.14 (see **A.15 Role–Method–Work**). | Keeps A.14 narrow and clean.          |


#### A.14:8.5 - CT2R‑LOG handshake (Working‑Model → Assurance)

| ID                 | Requirement                                                                                                                                                              | Purpose                                                                                 |

| **CC-A14-10**      | For **structural** edges on the Working-Model surface, authors **SHALL** set `validationMode=axiomatic` and attach **`tv:groundedBy → Γ_m.sum|set|slice`**.      | Aligns A.14 with CT2R-LOG (**B.3.5**) and Compose-CAL (**C.13**); ensures extensional identity. |
| **CC‑A14‑11**      | **PhaseOf** edges **SHALL NOT** use Γ\_m for grounding. Authors **SHALL** provide identity criteria and non‑overlap per **CC‑PHA‑1..3** and reference **Γ\_time** when ordering matters. | Keeps temporal parthood distinct from construction; preserves the plane firewall.       |

### A.14:9 - Validation patterns (author’s decision procedure)

**Step 0 — Firewall check.**
If your sentence contains *role*, *policy*, *process/workflow/SOP/script*, or *execution/run/job*, you are **not** in mereology; go to **A.15** (Role–Method–Work).

**Step 1 — Is it measured stuff?**
If yes, pick **PortionOf**. Confirm μ is declared (CC‑POR‑1/2). Test additivity on a toy split (CC‑POR‑3). If flows cross a boundary, remodel as interactions, not portions (CC‑POR‑4).

**Step 2 — Is it a discrete inside part?**
If yes, pick **ComponentOf** (physical) or **ConstituentOf** (conceptual). Do **not** use PortionOf here.

**Step 3 — Is it the same carrier at a time slice?**
If yes, pick **PhaseOf**. Verify identity criteria and non‑overlap (CC‑PHA‑1/2/3). If criteria break, escalate to **B.2** (CC‑PHA‑4).

**Step 4 — Is it a membership statement?**
Use **MemberOf** only; avoid any part‑inferences (CC‑MEM‑2). If you need a **collection as a whole**, use **C.13** (`Γ_m.set`) for constructive grounding. If you need **collective action**, defer to **A.15**.

**Quick spot‑tests (repair kit).**

| Smell                          | Likely error                      | Fix                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| “20% of the chassis”           | Treating structure as stuff       | Use **ComponentOf**; if truly laminar material, PortionOf applies to **material stock**, not the assembled chassis.          |
| “Chapter 2 is 15% of the book” | Mixing measures and constituents  | Use **ConstituentOf**; the 15% is **length‑of‑text** as a separate statement.                                                |
| “Spec v2 overlaps v1”          | Overlapping phases on same aspect | Use `PhaseOf(Spec_v2, Spec)` with non‑overlap; represent drafting as **Work** episodes (A.15) rather than overlapping specs. |
| “Team is part of the project”  | Member vs part confusion          | Use **MemberOf(Team, ProjectCollective)**, not partOf.                                                                       |


### A.14:10 - Interplay with Γ‑flavours (how these relations behave under aggregation)

| Γ‑flavour                    | Mereological hooks (what A.14 supplies)                                                                                                                | Key effect                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Γ\_sys (B.1.2)**          | Treat **PortionOf** as Σ‑additive stocks; **ComponentOf** must respect boundary integration; **PhaseOf** is not aggregated here.                       | Conserves extensive measures and keeps structural WLNK (weakest‑link) on components.          |
| **Γ\_epist (B.1.3)**         | **PortionOf** of texts/data uses μ = token/byte count; **ConstituentOf** composes arguments/sections; **PhaseOf** versions MethodDescriptions/documents.      | Preserves provenance and avoids trust inflation by keeping constituents vs portions distinct. |
| **Γ\_ctx / Γ\_time (B.1.4)** | **PhaseOf** provides the legal slicing for time and order; **PortionOf** is orthogonal (quantities inside steps).                                      | Ensures chronological consistency and monotone coverage.                                      |
| **Γ\_method (B.1.5)**          | Recipes are **MethodDescription** graphs (not parthood). When a recipe refers to stuff‑like inputs, those are **PortionOf** statements on resources.          | Separates recipe composition from structure.                                                  |
| **Γ\_work (B.1.6)**          | Only **Work** carries resource deltas; when logging “consumed 5 kg from Tank A”, model it as **PortionOf** relation to the stock prior to consumption. | Makes Σ‑balance explicit; aligns with CC‑POR‑3/4.                                             |

### A.14:11 - Consequences

**Benefits**

* **Predictable composition.** Σ‑additivity for portions and identity‑through‑time for phases make Γ‑proofs straightforward.
* **History without confusion.** Temporal slicing is explicit and audit‑ready; no paradoxical overlaps.
* **Cleaner integration with roles and recipes.** The firewall prevents “functional object” creep into structure.
* **Compatibility with engineering practice.** Mirrors *product breakdown* (components) vs *functional breakdown* (roles) vs *material stocks* (portions) vs *versioning* (phases).

**Trade‑offs / mitigations**

* **Modelling energy.** Authors must pick μ and declare units; provide a short μ‑catalog per project.
* **More relation names.** Two extra sub‑relations increase vocabulary; mitigated by the decision table (§ 6) and spot‑tests (§ 9).
* **Escalation discipline.** Deciding PhaseOf vs MHT requires judgement; A.14 provides criteria, and B.2 captures true re‑identification.

### A.14:12 - Pedagogy aids (non‑normative)

**Two‑minute checklist for reviewers**

1. Do I see “process/workflow/policy/script”? — then **A.15**, not mereology.
2. Does every PortionOf have a declared μ and unit?
3. Do phases cover a lifetime without overlap for the same aspect?
4. Are any roles/recipes appearing as parts? If yes, stop and refactor.

### A.14:13 - Patch map (where to touch in the working file)

1. **Kernel - Holonic Mereology (§ A.1 → A.14)**
   *Add* sub‑sections “PortionOf” and “PhaseOf” with axioms (POR‑1..5, PHA‑1..5).
   *Move* MemberOf note to a minimal semantics paragraph (no composition here).

2. **A.15 (Role–Method–Work)**
   *Cross‑link* firewall (CC‑A14‑0/0b) and reinforce that versioning uses **PhaseOf** only on MethodDescription/Work.

3. **B.1.2 Γ\_sys / B.1.3 Γ\_epist / B.1.4 Γ\_ctx/Γ\_time / B.1.5 Γ\_method / B.1.6 Γ\_work**
   *Insert* a one‑line “A.14 compliance” note: which A.14 sub‑relations each flavour relies on, as in § 10.

4. **Examples & Annexes**
   *Refactor* any “percentage as part” examples into PortionOf with declared μ;
   *Split* any overlapping histories into PhaseOf sequences.

Each edited heading should carry the badge **“► decided‑by: A.14 Advanced Mereology”**.

### A.14:14 - Rationale (state‑of‑the‑art alignment, post‑2015)

* **Metrical mereology** advances (e.g., recent work on quantity‑based parthood and additivity) motivate **PortionOf** with explicit μ and Σ‑laws, preventing the classic “stuff as components” fallacy.
* **Temporal parts & identity through change** (renewed treatments in analytic metaphysics and formal ontology) motivate **PhaseOf** with coverage/non‑overlap and escalation when identity criteria fail.
* **Engineering ontologies (BORO lineage, Core Constructional practice, ISO 15926 family)** keep a strict separation between **functional breakdowns** (our Roles) and **product breakdowns** (our Components), with **stock/consumable** modelling (our Portions) handled by quantities, not by component trees.
* **Knowledge artefact lifecycles** in contemporary MBSE and open‑science workflows use explicit versioning (our PhaseOf) and provenance‑preserving composition (our ConstituentOf).
* The net effect is a **minimal‑sufficient** catalogue: two added sub‑relations close real modelling gaps while preserving **parsimony**, **didactic clarity**, and **Γ‑compatibility** across domains.
