## B.2 - Meta‑Holon Transition (MHT): Recognizing Emergence and Re‑identifying Wholes

> **Plain‑English headline.**
> When composition yields a **new, coherent whole**—with its **own boundary**, **objective**, and **capabilities** that cannot be faithfully treated as “just parts folded together”—declare a **Meta‑Holon Transition**. Record the **event** that created the new holon and let the Γ‑invariants apply **anew** at the higher level.

### B.2:1 - Problem frame

* **Universal composition (B.1)** provides Γ‑flavours for structure (**Γ\_sys**, **Γ\_epist**), order (**Γ\_ctx/Γ\_method**), and time (**Γ\_time**). These flavours preserve **WLNK** and **MONO** and—except for order/time cases—assume **local commutativity**.
* **Mereology (A.14)** distinguishes **ComponentOf / ConstituentOf** (structure), **SerialStepOf / ParallelFactorOf** (order), and **PhaseOf** (temporal parts of the **same** carrier).
* **Strict Distinction (A.15)** separates **structure**, **order**, **time**, **cost**, and **values**; we must not disguise emergence as arithmetic “optimism” or as a type error.
* In practice, some compositions produce **qualitatively new behaviour** (e.g., a closed feedback loop enabling regulation; an integrated argument that becomes explanatory rather than merely descriptive). FPF names this **Meta‑Holon Transition** (MHT) and treats it as a **first‑class modelling move**.

FPF’s stance on **identity across time** is **ecumenical**: both **4D extensional** and **3D+1 endurantist** readings are admissible **as long as** the modeller makes **identity and event boundaries explicit**:

* In **4D**, a holon is a world‑tube; **events** are boundaries between **temporal parts**; `PhaseOf` picks out segments; an MHT marks a **new tube** beginning (re‑identification).
* In **3D+1**, a holon endures; **events** are state transitions; `PhaseOf` are time‑indexed **states**; an MHT marks **creation** of a **new enduring entity** and its relations to predecessors.

FPF does **not** force a metaphysical choice; it requires **clear declarations** so Γ‑proofs and B.3‑assurance remain unambiguous.


### B.2:2 - Problem

Without an explicit MHT pattern, four pathologies recur:

1. **Invariant evasion:** When redundancy or coordination lifts performance above the **weakest‑link** bound, authors “massage” arithmetic instead of acknowledging **new structure/closure**.
2. **Identity drift:** A system changes boundary, objective, or supervisory structure, yet the model silently treats it as the “same holon,” corrupting histories (**Γ\_time**) and claims (**B.3**).
3. **Context leakage:** A composite crosses a **bounded context** (new vocabulary, units, policy), but the model keeps scoring in the old context, inflating **R\_eff** by ignoring **congruence penalties**.
4. **Order/time confusion:** Genuinely **order‑dependent synergies** (Γ\_ctx/Γ\_method) or **phase consolidations** (Γ\_time) are misrepresented as simple structural sums (Γ\_sys), losing causal and temporal meaning.


### B.2:3 - Forces

| Force                                       | Tension                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Parsimony vs. Expressivity**              | Keep the core algebra small (A.11) ↔ Admit real emergence when closure or supervision appears.                                                              |
| **Continuity vs. Re‑identification**        | Preserve identity across phases where warranted ↔ Re‑identify when boundary/objective/capability qualitatively change.                                      |
| **Local vs. Systemic**                      | Local improvements should stay inside MONO ↔ System‑level novelties must **restart** invariants at a new level.                                             |
| **DDD familiarity vs. Ontological clarity** | Reuse intuitions from **bounded contexts** and **events** ↔ Keep them mapped to FPF’s holons, boundaries, and transformers without tool‑specific semantics. |


### B.2:4 - Solution — **Part 1: What an MHT is, when to declare it, and how it relates to Γ**

#### B.2:4.1 - Definition (normative)

A **Meta‑Holon Transition (MHT)** is a **declared event** in which a configuration of holons—previously related by Γ‑composition in some flavour—**is promoted** to a **new holon** `H⁺` with a **new or revised**:

* **Boundary** (external interface and enclosure, per A.14/B.1.2),
* **Objective / Evaluation basis** (what `H⁺` tries to maintain/achieve), and/or
* **Supervisory structure / Capability** (closed feedback, decision loop, policy enactment).

After MHT, the Γ‑invariants apply **afresh** to `H⁺` and its parts. Prior assurance (B.3) remains valid for **pre‑MHT** claims; **post‑MHT** claims are assessed for `H⁺` under its own boundary, objective, and context.

> **Didactic guard‑rail.**
> If a perceived “synergy” is fully explainable **within the current Γ‑flavour**—e.g., by raising congruence **CL**, improving parts (MONO), or fixing order (Γ\_ctx)—**do not** declare MHT. MHT is reserved for **new closure** or **new supervision** that changes what counts as “the whole”.


#### B.2:4.2 - Triggers for declaring MHT (BOSC‑A‑T‑X)

Declare MHT when one or more of the following **observable triggers** occur (measurements are recorded in the promotion record):

* **B — Boundary closure/opening.** A coherent external boundary emerges (e.g., internal interfaces encapsulated; single regulated port) or its **type** changes (open ↔ closed/permeable) such that the system’s external commitments are different.
* **O — Objective emergence/reframe.** A new objective is instituted (e.g., regulation target introduced) or a prior objective becomes subordinate to a supervisory objective.
* **S — Structural re‑organization for supervision.** New **coordination channels** or a feedback loop close a circuit that **did not exist** at the previous level, producing regulation or self‑maintenance.
* **C — Capability super‑additivity (beyond WLNK).** Measured capability (or assurance) exceeds the **weakest‑link** bound **without** being explainable by improved parts or higher **CL** under the current Γ semantics.
* **A — Agency threshold crossing (A.13).** The holon begins to **play AgentialRole** with an **agency grade** sufficient to maintain objectives autonomously; this lifts the system into a supervisory regime.
* **T — Temporal consolidation.** Across **Γ\_time** phases, properties consolidate into a qualitatively new regime (e.g., commissioning → operational service) that **re‑anchors identity** or boundary.
* **X — Context rebase (bounded context).** The holon’s operative **vocabulary/units/policy** shift to a **new bounded context** (in DDD sense), requiring a new **Assurance context** and CL baselines.

> **Rule of thumb.**
> BOSC touches **what the holon is**; A/T/X touch **how and where it lives** (agency, time, context). Any **two** of these together almost always warrant MHT.


#### B.2:4.3 - Identity stance: 4D vs. 3D+1 (FPF’s ecumenical Standard)

FPF permits both readings **provided** you make **identity and event claims explicit**:

* **4D Standard:**

  * Pre‑MHT configuration is a set of world‑tube segments linked by Γ.
  * The **MHT event** marks the start of a **new tube** `H⁺`; earlier segments remain as precursors.
  * `PhaseOf` refers to **temporal parts**; **events** are boundaries between parts (and between tubes at MHT).

* **3D+1 Standard:**

  * Pre‑MHT configuration is an enduring holon with time‑indexed states.
  * The **MHT event** is a creation event for **a new enduring holon** `H⁺`; a mapping relates `H⁺` to predecessors.
  * `PhaseOf` refers to **states**; **events** are transitions; MHT is a re‑identification point.

**Normative bridge:** Regardless of stance, you **must** (i) state whether identity **continues** (PhaseOf) or a **new identity** is created, and (ii) record the **Transformer** that performs the MHT.


#### B.2:4.4 - Event taxonomy for MHT (small, reusable set)

To avoid ad‑hoc naming, choose one **event type** (or a pair) and fill its parameters:

1. **Fusion** — several holons become `H⁺` with a new boundary/objective/supervision.
2. **Fission** — one holon splits into several peers, each with a proper boundary/objective.
3. **Phase Promotion** — a **Γ\_time** phase boundary coincides with BOSC‑A‑T‑X conditions; identity is re‑anchored to `H⁺`.
4. **Role‑Lift** — the holon starts **playing AgentialRole** at or above a declared grade threshold (A.13), enabling supervision.
5. **Context Reframe** — the holon’s bounded context shifts (terminology/units/policy), establishing `H⁺` in the **new context**; mappings to the prior context are recorded.

These are **Transformer events** (A.12). They do **not** imply toolchains or storage; they are conceptual commitments with audit fields.


#### B.2:4.5 - How MHT relates to Γ‑flavours and bounded contexts

* **With Γ\_sys / Γ\_epist (structure):**

  * If measured capability or assurance exceeds **WLNK** under current semantics, and the excess **cannot** be explained by **part improvements** or **CL** increases, **do not bend arithmetic**—declare MHT.
  * After MHT, the new holon `H⁺` re‑establishes its own WLNK/CL baselines.

* **With Γ\_ctx / Γ\_method (order):**

  * If introducing order/joins **creates a closed supervisory loop** that maintains an objective (e.g., sense → decide → actuate), declare **Role‑Lift** or **Fusion** MHT.
  * If order simply fixes a previously mis‑modelled sequence, that is **not** MHT; it is a normal correction under Γ\_ctx.

* **With Γ\_time (phases):**

  * Use **PhaseOf** for normal state progressions where identity continues.
  * If a phase boundary coincides with BOSC‑A‑T‑X, **Phase Promotion** MHT creates `H⁺`; histories remain linked but assurances are **not silently merged**.

* **With bounded contexts (DDD intuition):**

  * A **bounded context** is a **modelling Standard** (vocabulary/units/policy). Crossing it without re‑baselining **CL** causes **trust inflation**.
  * Use **Context Reframe** MHT to re‑anchor `H⁺` in the new context and declare the mappings; B.3’s congruence penalty `Φ(CL)` now refers to the **new** baseline.


#### B.2:4.6 - What MHT is *not* (didactic contrasts)

* **Not a shortcut around WLNK/Φ.** If synergy is explainable by raising `CL` or improving parts, stay within Γ and B.3.
* **Not every KPI jump.** If the jump is within the declared envelope and context, **no** MHT is needed.
* **Not a version bump.** Version changes (`PhaseOf`) with the **same identity** are **Γ\_time**, not MHT.
* **Not “agent = new type.”** Agency is **a role** (A.13); MHT only when role enactment **changes closure/supervision** at the system level.

### B.2:5 - Promotion Record & proof obligations (normative)

To declare an MHT you MUST create a **Promotion Record** that makes identity, boundary, objective, supervision, and context shifts explicit. This record extends the general proof kit in **B.1.1**.

#### B.2:5.1 - Promotion Record — minimal fields

```
MHT.PromotionRecord
  id:                unique identifier
  eventType:         one of {Fusion | Fission | PhasePromotion | Role‑Lift | ContextReframe}

  identityStance:    one of {4D | 3D+1}
  preConfig:
    nodes:           list of holons (ids, kinds) involved before MHT
    edges:           list of relations & their types (A.14), including CL on integration edges
    Γflavour:        active Γ-flavour(s) prior to MHT
    assurance:       Assurance tuples for relevant claims before MHT (B.3)
    boundedContext:  name or description (vocabulary/units/policy) before MHT
  triggers:
    BOSC:            {B? O? S? C?} with measurements/artefacts
    A?               Agency-CHR grade & context (A.13)

    EvidenceGraphRef:          references to measurements, specs, interface Standards, tests
    orderTimeRefs:            OrderSpec/TimeWindow if Γ\_ctx/Γ\_time material
```

#### B.2:5.2 - Proof obligations specific to MHT

* **MHT‑BOSC‑EVD.** For each selected trigger (B/O/S/C/A/T/X), attach the artefacts that evidence it (e.g., boundary Standard for **B**, policy/regulation objective text for **O**, controller‑plant diagram for **S**, capability measurement vs WLNK bound for **C**, Agency‑CHR record for **A**, phase coverage & carrier identity for **T**, context mapping & unit schemes for **X**).

* **MHT‑NO‑EVADE.** Show that the observed improvement cannot be explained by **within‑Γ** moves alone: improved parts (MONO), raised congruence CL, corrected order (Γ\_ctx), or richer phase coverage (Γ\_time). If any of those suffice, **MHT is not justified**.

* **MHT‑ASS‑REBAS.** Provide **before/after** assurance tuples (B.3) for the same typed claim(s) or justify claim changes; do not fuse design/run scopes.

* **MHT‑IDENT.** State identity stance (4D or 3D+1) and the identity mapping (continuation vs new identity). Mixing stances in the same record is forbidden.

* **MHT‑CTX‑MAP.** For **ContextReframe**, list the concept/unit/terminology mappings and their CL levels; record the **new CL baseline** for future aggregations.


### B.2:6 - Archetypal cases (worked, didactic)

#### B.2:6.1 - System — **Closed‑loop regulation emerges from components** (Fusion / Role‑Lift)

* **Pre‑config:** Plant, sensor, actuator exist; analyses show performance capped by **WLNK** path through the slowest actuator; interfaces calibrated at CL2. No supervisory closure.

* **Trigger:** **S** (supervisory structure closes a feedback loop) and **B** (boundary now exports a single regulated interface; internal ports encapsulated). Capability exceeds prior WLNK bound without any part upgrade.

* **MHT:** Declare **Fusion** (or **Role‑Lift** if the controller plays AgentialRole). Create `H⁺ = RegulatedSystem` with BIC exposing the regulated port and supervisory objective (“maintain y≈r”).

* **After:** Γ‑invariants re‑start for `H⁺`. **B.3** assurance uses a new cutset; congruence on controller–plant mapping is part of `CL_min`.

* **Why not within‑Γ?** The performance jump is not due to improved parts or raised CL on existing edges; it stems from **new closure**.

#### B.2:6.2 - Episteme — **From compendium to theory** (Fusion / ContextReframe)

* **Pre‑config:** Several high‑quality results integrated as a catalogue; mappings among constructs are at CL1 (loose analogies).

* **Trigger:** **O** (a unifying explanatory **objective**: predict & explain class Q), **C** (explanatory success beyond min of parts), **X** (terminology reframed around new primitives with verified mapping at CL2/CL3).

* **MHT:** **Fusion** + **ContextReframe** to `H⁺ = Theory_T` with an explanatory objective; mappings to the prior compendium are documented.

* **After:** Assurance for “explains Q within δ” starts at `H⁺` with its own `F_eff` (may rise if formalized), `G_eff` (supported domain), and `R_eff` penalized by the **new** mapping CL.

#### B.2:6.3 - Temporal — **Commissioning → Operations** (PhasePromotion)

* **Pre‑config:** `PhaseOf` slices (install, calibrate, trial). Identity of the same carrier is maintained.

* **Trigger:** **T** (phase boundary) plus **B** (boundary type changes: open commissioning ports are encapsulated) and **O** (objective shifts from “achieve acceptance tests” to “deliver service SLA”).

* **MHT:** **PhasePromotion** creates `H⁺ = System‑in‑Operation`. Past phases remain as documented temporal parts; design‑time assurance is not mixed with run‑time assurance.

#### B.2:6.4 - Context — **Prototype → Certified product** (ContextReframe)

* **Pre‑config:** Prototype in a lab context with ad‑hoc units and informal safety claims.

* **Trigger:** **X** (bounded context shifts to regulated environment), **F rises** (formal safety case), **CL** for unit/requirement mappings vetted.

* **MHT:** **ContextReframe** to `H⁺ = CertifiedProduct`; new **BIC** and regulatory vocabulary become the baseline; earlier lab claims are not silently “ported”.


### B.2:6.5 - Certification Interface Example *(Informative)*

Conceptual signature (notation‑neutral):

```
certify(role, context, window, snapshot, options) → StateAssertion
```

**Sketch.** `snapshot` contains coordinates over the Role’s RCS (A.19). `options` may reference named **NormalizationMethod(s)**/**NormalizationMethodInstance(s)** and overlays used in evaluation. The resulting **StateAssertion** states the target state (by name), the checklist applied (by name), the verdict, the window, and (if used) the **declared** **Bridge** or **NormalizationMethodInstance** employed for translation.  
**Intent.** This example aids implementers; **normative constraints** on comparability, normalization, and evidence live in **A.19** and **C.16**, not here.

### B.2:7 - Conformance Checklist (normative)

| ID          | Requirement                                                                                                                     | Purpose                                            |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **CC‑B2.1** | An MHT MUST have a **Promotion Record** with fields in §5.1 completed and **identityStance** chosen.                            | Avoid ambiguous identity shifts.                   |
| **CC‑B2.2** | MHT MAY be declared only when at least **one BOSC‑A‑T‑X** trigger is evidenced and **MHT‑NO‑EVADE** holds.                      | Prevent “emergence by arithmetic”.                 |
| **CC‑B2.3** | Post‑MHT holon `H⁺` MUST provide **BIC** (boundary), an **objective** statement, and (if present) a supervisory description.    | Re‑anchor what the whole **is**.                   |
| **CC‑B2.4** | Pre‑ and post‑assurance MUST be reported as **separate** tuples (B.3).                                                          | No design/run or context chimeras.                 |
| **CC‑B2.5** | **ContextReframe** MHT MUST include the mapping set and CL levels; **R\_eff** thereafter uses the **new CL baseline**.          | Make context explicit; reset penalties coherently. |
| **CC‑B2.6** | **PhasePromotion** MUST state whether identity continues (4D: new tube start; 3D+1: new enduring holon) and justify the choice. | Keep temporal semantics clear.                     |
| **CC‑B2.7** | **Role‑Lift** MUST reference Agency‑CHR but MUST NOT use agency to bypass WLNK or CL penalties.                                 | Preserve safety invariants.                        |


### B.2:8 - Anti‑patterns & repairs

| Anti‑pattern               | Symptom                                                 | Repair                                                                              |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Emergence by averaging** | Post‑composition KPI > WLNK, justified by means/weights | Declare MHT only if BOSC/S is met; otherwise raise CL or improve parts within Γ.    |
| **Invisible context hop**  | New units/terms silently adopted                        | Use **ContextReframe**; record mappings and CL; re‑baseline assurance.              |
| **Every phase = MHT**      | Each version treated as a new holon                     | Use **PhaseOf** for ordinary state progressions; reserve MHT for BOSC‑A‑T‑X.        |
| **Agency as type**         | Introduce `U.Agent` and claim new identity              | Keep agency as role (A.13); MHT only if supervision/closure changes the whole.      |
| **Boundary amnesia**       | Interfaces changed but not recorded                     | Update BIC; if external commitments change materially, declare MHT.                 |
| **Order magic**            | Reordering steps treated as emergence                   | If order fixes correctness (Γ\_ctx), no MHT; only closed loops/supervision qualify. |


### B.2:9 - Consequences

**Benefits**

* **Clarity & auditability.** Distinguishes **improvement within a level** from **creation of a new whole**.
* **Invariant integrity.** WLNK and CL penalties are preserved; when a new whole appears, invariants restart cleanly.
* **Method‑agnostic synergy.** Works with both **4D** and **3D+1** readings; dovetails with DDD’s **bounded contexts** and event‑centric modelling.
* **Easier assurance management.** Pre/post claims are comparable without being conflated; teams can plan targeted moves (raise CL, formalize, reframe context).

**Trade‑offs**

* **Extra documentation at the right time.** Declaring MHT is deliberate; it requires a Promotion Record and evidence.
* **Identity bookkeeping.** Teams must choose an identity stance and be consistent; this cost buys cross‑scale coherence.


### B.2:10 - Rationale (informative)

* **Systems & control:** Closing feedback creates **new closed‑loop properties** not attributable to parts alone; treating this as an MHT avoids “synergy by arithmetic” and aligns with classical supervisory control and contemporary active‑inference views (A.13).
* **Mereology & identity:** By remaining **ecumenical** (4D or 3D+1) but **Standardual** about identity declarations, FPF stays compatible with traditions akin to **BORO** (4D‑leaning) and **CCO** (endurantist uses), while keeping proofs unambiguous.
* **DDD/Event‑centric modelling:** Popular practices (bounded contexts, event storming) pivot on **events** and **context boundaries**. MHT makes such events **first‑class** in FPF, turns context hops into explicit **ContextReframe** transitions, and ties them to assurance via **CL baselines**.
* **Assurance discipline:** Re‑baselining **F/G/R** and **CL** at MHT points prevents cross‑context overconfidence and enables principled improvement plans.


### B.2:11 - Relations

* **Builds on:** A.12 (Transformer), A.13 (AgentialRole & Agency‑CHR), A.14 (Mereology Extension), A.15 (Strict Distinction); B.1.x (Γ flavours), B.3 (Assurance).
* **Used by:** B.4 (Evolution Loops: MHT as macro‑steps on the loop), KD‑CAL action patterns (when re‑framing models/theories).
* **Complements:** B.1.4 (Γ\_ctx/Γ\_time) by distinguishing **order/phase** corrections from **emergence**; B.1.2/B.1.3 by restarting compositional invariants at the new level.

> **One‑sentence takeaway.**
> **Declare MHT** when closure, supervision, or context re‑base creates a **new whole**; document the event, reset invariants, and keep pre/post assurance cleanly separated.
