## Quick Domain Selection

**Choose domain based on your task:**

**Core domains (most frequently needed):**
- **System modeling** → [foundations](#foundations) (entities, roles, distinctions)
- **Task execution** → [transformation](#transformation) (methods, work, plans)
- **Evidence validation** → [trust-evidence](#trust-evidence) (F-G-R, reliability)
- **Problem-solving** → [reasoning](#reasoning) (abduction, exploration)

**Specialized domains:**
- **Interface design** → [signature](#signature) (boundaries, contracts, morphisms)
- **Composition** → [aggregation](#aggregation) (Gamma, meta-transitions)
- **Cross-context mapping** → [unification](#unification) (bridges, concept-sets)
- **Domain calculi** → [architheories](#architheories) (Kind-CAL, KD-CAL, etc.)
- **FPF authoring** → [constitution](#constitution) (lexical rules, patterns)
- **Benchmarking** → [sota](#sota) (discipline packs, telemetry)
- **Ethical assurance** → [ethics](#ethics) (bias-audit)
