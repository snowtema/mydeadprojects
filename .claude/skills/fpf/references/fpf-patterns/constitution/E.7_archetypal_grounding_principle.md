## E.7 - Archetypal Grounding Principle

### E.7:1 - Problem frame
Universal rules are powerful only when readers can grasp them. In FPF the
Conceptual Core speaks in substrate‑agnostic language: `U.Holon`,
Γ‑aggregation, MHT emergence. Practitioners need to “see” those rules in
familiar matter—physical hardware or bodies of knowledge—before they can
reuse them.

### E.7:2 - Problem
A purely abstract statement risks two failures:

1. **Didactic failure** – readers dismiss the pattern as “too meta,”
   violating Pillar **P‑2 Didactic Primacy**.  
2. **Unproven universality** – without cross‑domain instantiation the rule
   remains an untested claim.

### E.7:3 - Forces

| Force | Tension |
|-------|---------|
| **Universality vs Concreteness** | Abstract law ↔ concrete example. |
| **Brevity vs Clarity** | Spec should stay concise ↔ dual examples add length. |
| **Rigour vs Accessibility** | Formal semantics ↔ intuitive narrative. |

### E.7:4 - Solution — mandatory *Archetypal Grounding* subsection

Every architectural pattern **SHALL** include a dedicated
section, titled exactly **“Archetypal Grounding,”** that *shows* how the
abstract law SCRs in FPF’s two canonical holon flavours:

1. **`U.System`** – the archetype of a **physical, operational holon**.  
2. **`U.Episteme`** – the archetype of an **abstract, epistemic holon**.

This enforces a repeatable **Tell‑Show‑Show** rhythm:

| Stage | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Tell** | `Solution` section states the universal rule. |
| **Show #1** | `Archetypal Grounding` – concrete `U.System` example. |
| **Show #2** | Same section – parallel `U.Episteme` example. |

### E.7:5 - Archetypal Grounding (of this pattern itself)

| Universal rule | `U.System` instantiation | `U.Episteme` instantiation |
|----------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| “Every architectural pattern requires grounding.” | Pattern *D.1 Algebra of Aggregation* illustrates Γ\_sys on assembling a water pump. | The same pattern illustrates Γ_epist on merging a meta‑analysis. |

### E.7:6 - Conformance Checklist

| ID | Requirement | Purpose |
|----|-------------|---------|
| **CC‑AG.1** | Every architectural pattern in Parts A, B, C, D, E **SHALL** contain a subsection headed exactly *“Archetypal Grounding”*. | Guarantees consistent Tell‑Show‑Show rhythm. |
| **CC‑AG.2** | The Archetypal Grounding subsection **MUST** illustrate the rule with both `U.System` *and* `U.Episteme`. | Demonstrates trans‑disciplinary reach. |
| **CC‑AG.3** | If a rule intentionally applies to only one substrate, the subsection **SHALL** state the scope limitation and justify it against the five Principle‑Taxonomy lenses (`Gov`, `Arch`, `Onto/Epist`, `Prag`, `Did`). | Prevents silent bias; links to Bias‑Audit guard‑rail. |
| **CC‑AG.4** | Patterns lacking a compliant Archetypal Grounding subsection **MAY NOT** progress to “Accepted” status. | Enforces discipline without referring to workflow mechanics. |

### E.7:7 - Consequences

| Benefits | Trade‑offs / Mitigations |
|----------|-------------------------|
| **Immediate clarity** – readers see abstract laws in action. | Patterns grow by one short table; mitigated by consistent template snippet. |
| **Proof of universality** – every rule is self‑documenting across substrates. | Authors must think cross‑domain; fosters richer patterns. |
| **Narrative cohesion** – recurring System/Episteme protagonists create a memorable storyline. | — |
|Built-in Proof of Universality: The specification consistently demonstrates its trans-disciplinary claims, building trust and credibility. | — |

### E.7:8 - Rationale
Tell‑Show‑Show is a proven pedagogical sequence. By making it normative,
FPF hard‑codes **P‑2 Didactic Primacy** into the fabric of every architectural
pattern while still honouring **P‑1 Cognitive Elegance**—the grounding
section replaces brittle ad‑hoc anecdotes with a disciplined dual
example. Linking scope‑justification to the five Principle lenses ties the
pattern to the **Taxonomy‑Guided Bias Audit** and keeps governance
language out of the Core.

### E.7:9 - Relations

* **Implements macro flow:** `pat:authoring/didactic‑architecture` (E.6)  
* **References base types:** `pat:kernel/holon` (A.1) (`U.System`, `U.Episteme`)  
* **Interacts with bias guard‑rail:** `pat:guard/bias‑audit` (E.5.4) via CC‑AG.3  
* **Constrains:** Authoring template in `pat:authoring/pattern‑template` (E.8)
