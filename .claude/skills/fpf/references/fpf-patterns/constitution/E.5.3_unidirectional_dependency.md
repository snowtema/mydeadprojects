## E.5.3 - Unidirectional Dependency

### E.5.3:1 - Problem frame
FPF separates artefacts into stable **Conceptual Core**, executable
**Tooling Reference**, and fast‑evolving **Pedagogical Companion** (see
E.4 Artefact Architecture).  If dependencies can point *both* ways,
volatile layers will eventually drag the Core into rapid revision
cycles or introduce domain‑specific bias.

### E.5.3:2 - Problem
*Architectural gravity*: a tutorial or helper script adds a new feature,
Core patterns import it “temporarily,” and within months the supposedly
timeless layer depends on transient assets—breaking Pillar **P‑5
FPF Layering**.

### E.5.3:3 - Forces

| Force | Tension |
|-------|---------|
| **Agility vs Stability** | Tooling must iterate quickly ↔ Core must remain slow and deliberate. |
| **Reuse vs Isolation** | Authors want to reuse helper concepts ↔ Core cannot depend on volatile code. |
| **Simplicity** | Rule must be testable and unambiguous ↔ must allow legitimate upward imports. |

### E.5.3:4 - Solution — One‑Way, Acyclic Imports
Define a strict **partial order** over artefact families **and guard meaning flow** (see **E.10 V‑1**): imports point only **upward** in stability, and **no Core semantics** may derive from Tooling/Pedagogy. No linters or machine checking in Conceptual Core.

**`imports` is a dependency DAG, not a specialisation relation (normative).** Whenever an artefact exposes an explicit `imports : [...]` list (e.g., `SignatureManifest.imports` in A.6.0), treat `imports` as **dependency edges** governed by this section: the induced `imports` graph MUST be **acyclic** (a DAG) and MUST respect the declared direction. `imports` MUST NOT be used to encode *specialisation* (e.g., `⊑` / `⊑⁺` between mechanisms); specialisation relations are declared separately via the relevant morphism/ladder rules (e.g., A.6.1 `U.MechMorph`).

Pedagogical Companion  ⟶  Tooling Reference  ⟶  Conceptual Core

1. **Allowed edges**  
   Dependencies **MAY** point **only upward** (toward greater semantic
   stability). No cycle is ever permitted.

2. **No downward import**  
   Core artefacts **SHALL NOT** import Tooling or Pedagogy artefacts.
   Tooling artefacts **SHALL NOT** import Pedagogy artefacts.

3. **Future layers**  
   Any new family is inserted below an existing one or becomes part of
   the Tooling or Pedagogy strata; the ordering extends accordingly.

### E.5.3:5 - Archetypal Grounding (System / Episteme)

| Layer | `U.System` illustration | `U.Episteme` illustration |
|-------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Core | Definition of `U.System` and boundary invariant. | Definition of F‑G‑R characteristics. |
| Tooling | “Reference system‑profile” that checks boundary flow; *imports* Core invariants. | “Episteme‑scoring routine” that calculates R‑score; *imports* Core characteristics. |
| Pedagogy | Tutorial using the system‑profile to model a pump; *imports* profile and Core term. | Case study explaining R‑score evolution; *imports* scoring routine and Core term. |
| **Forbidden** | Core pattern importing measurement script. | Core pattern importing R‑score web dashboard. |

### E.5.3:6 - Conformance Checklist

| ID | Requirement |
|----|-------------|
| **CC‑UD.1** | Dependency graph among all artefacts **MUST** be acyclic. |
| **CC‑UD.2** | An artefact **SHALL** import only from its own family or any family above it in the order. |
| **CC‑UD.3** | A DRR that introduces a downward edge **SHALL** be automatically rejected. |

### E.5.3:7 - Consequences

| Benefits | Trade‑offs / Mitigations |
|----------|-------------------------|
| Core stays free of tool churn and tutorial bias. | Authors must create abstraction layers in Tooling instead of inserting hooks into Core. |
| Release cadence decoupled: Core (slow), Tooling (medium), Pedagogy (fast). | Slight duplication when multiple tools target same concept; mitigated by shared Core definitions. |

### E.5.3:8 - Rationale
One‑way import graphs are a proven safeguard in operating systems
(kernel vs user land) and layered protocols. Here the rule operationalises
Pillars **P‑4 Open‑Ended Kernel** and **P‑5 FPF Layering**, ensuring
that innovation happens “below” without contaminating the timeless Core.

### E.5.3:9 - Relations
* **Parent umbrella:** `pat:constitution/guard‑rails` (E.5)  
* **References layer definition:** `pat:constitution/artefact‑architecture` (E.4)  
* **Instantiates pillars:** P‑4, P‑5  
* **Constrains:** All artefact imports recorded in DRRs or SCRs
