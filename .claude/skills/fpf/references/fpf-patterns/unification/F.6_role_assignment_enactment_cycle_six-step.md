## F.6 - Role Assignment & Enactment Cycle (Six-Step)

**“Assign only what you can later justify by local meaning and observable facts.”**
**Status.** Architectural pattern.
**Depends on.** E.10.D1 **Lexical Discipline for “Context” (D.CTX)**; F.1 **Domain‑Family Landscape Survey**; F.2 **Term Harvesting & Normalisation**; F.3 **Intra‑Context Sense Clustering**; F.4 **Role Description**; F.5 **Naming Discipline**.
**Coordinates with.** F.7 **Concept‑Set Table**; F.8 **Mint or Reuse?**; F.9 **Alignment & Bridge**; F.10 **Epistemic Status Mapping**; A.2.1 **U.RoleAssignment**; A.15.\* **Role–Method–Work alignment**; KD‑CAL (observations, results).
**Aliases (informative).** *Assign-and-verify mental loop*; *six-step role cycle*.

### F.6:1 - Intent & applicability

**Intent.** Provide a **minimal set of reasoning moves** that turn a **Role Description** (F.4), anchored in a **SenseCell**, into a **sound claim** about a concrete **holder**—either a **Role assignment** or a **Status assertion**—with **local meaning** (within one context) and a **clear path to evidence** (KD‑CAL). These are **mental moves**, not workflows or tools.

**Applicability.** Any time you (a) bind a system to a **Role** mask, or (b) assert a **Status** about a system/artefact, **inside one U.BoundedContext**. Use when drafting models, reconciling vocabularies, or reading external canons.

**Non‑goals.** No process charts, no registries, no governance roles. No Cross‑context equivalences (that is F.9). No operational runbooks—only conceptual judgements.

### F.6:2 - Problem frame

Without disciplined Role Assignment & Enactment reasoning:

1. **Sense‑family slippage.** Behavioural **Roles** and deontic/epistemic **Statuses** get mixed (keep them on distinct **senseFamilies**, per F.0.1).
2. **Context drift.** A label is lifted from one canon and used as if universal.
3. **Evidence vacuum.** Assignments are asserted with no thought to what could **show** they hold.
4. **Time blur.** Design‑time masks are judged by run‑time traces (or vice versa).
5. **Name inflation.** New labels are minted to patch noisy assignments.

### F.6:3 - Forces

| Force                       | Tension to resolve                                                                   |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Locality vs reuse**       | Keep meaning inside one context while still naming things once across examples.         |
| **Clarity vs completeness** | State enough to be checkable without burying the reader in conditions.               |
| **Design vs run**           | Keep **stance** coherent: design‑time bindings are judged by design artefacts; if you need run‑time verification, express it as a **run‑Status/Role** Template—without confusing **stances** (A.7). |
| **Fact vs promise**         | Evidence (KD‑CAL) vs deontic expectations (service, policy) must not collapse.       |

### F.6:4 - Minimal vocabulary (this pattern only)

* **Context** — shorthand for **U.BoundedContext** (per E.10.D1).
* **SenseCell σ** — **address** **⟨Context C × Local‑Sense ℓ⟩** per F.3. (Informative: we write simply **σ**; it already contains **C**.)
* **Role Description** — a **Role** or **Status** card anchored in a SenseCell (F.4).
* **Holder** — the concrete system/artefact considered for a **Role** binding.
* **Subject** — the referent of a **Status** assertion; determined by the Template (may or may not be the Holder).
* **subject_of(τ, H)** — function yielding the **Subject** for Status assertions given Template **τ** (and, if needed, candidate **H**).
* **Eligibility** — conditions on the Holder that *must* hold to apply the Template (F.4 invariants).
* **Window** — the DesignRunTag or interval relevant to the claim (design/run; instant/period).
* **Evidence shape** — the **Observation/Result/Procedure/Feature** pattern (KD‑CAL) that could confirm/refute the claim in its Context.

### F.6:5 - Pre‑conditions (lightweight)

1. The **Context** is in your F.1 cut; **Context ≡ U.BoundedContext**.
2. The **Template** references a **SenseCell** in that Context (F.4).
3. The **Holder** is identified (by type or instance) without relying on Cross‑context mappings.

### F.6:6 - The six moves (judgement schemas, notation‑free)

Each move is a **thought you can justify**, expressed as `premises ⊢ conclusion`.
All moves are **context‑local** and **side‑effect free** (they assert knowledge; they do not modify artefacts).

#### F.6:6.1 - M1 - Locate — *Fix the Context and the Template*

**Form.**
`Template τ anchored at SenseCell σ≡⟨C, ℓ⟩ ⊢ address(τ) = σ`

**Reading.** Name the Context and the exact SenseCell that gives **local meaning** to the Template.
**Note.** This forbids “floating” Roles/Statuses and prevents Context drift.

#### F.6:6.2 - M2 - Stance — *Respect DesignRunTag*

**Form.**
`stance(C)=s ∧ stance(τ)∈{s, both} ⊢ compatible_stance(τ,C)`

**Reading.** The Template’s DesignRunTag is **compatible** with its Context’s stance (design vs run).
**Note.** Guards against judging a design‑mask by run‑traces or judging a run‑status by design artefacts.

#### F.6:6.3 - M3 - Qualify — *Check Holder eligibility*

**Form.**
`Holder H ∧ eligibility(τ) holds in C ⊢ eligible(H, τ @ C)`

**Reading.** Given the Template’s eligibility predicates (F.4), the Holder qualifies to be bound/assessed **in this Context**.
**Note.** Typical predicates: **type membership**, **capability present**, **scope fit**; all context‑local.

#### F.6:6.4 - M4 - Bind/Assert — *Make the Role Assignment / Status claim*

**Role assignment (behavioural mask).**
`eligible(H, τ @ C) ∧ window W ⊢ plays_role(H, τ : C) @ W`

**Status assertion (epistemic/deontic state).**
`eligible(H, τ @ C) ∧ window W ∧ S = subject_of(τ, H) ⊢ has_status(S, τ : C) @ W`

**Reading.** Assert either a **Role** binding or a **Status** about the appropriate subject (system, artefact, service), within a **Window**.
**Note.** The **subject** of a Status may differ from the Role holder (e.g., a *service* has SLO status; a *team* plays a Role).

#### F.6:6.5 - M5 - Evidence — *Shape what would make it true/false*

**Form.**
`plays_role/has_status κ in C ⊢ evidence_shape(κ) = Σ(C)`

**Reading.** From the Context’s semantics, state the **Observation/Result** pattern (KD‑CAL) that would confirm or refute the claim (**what**, **where**, **when**).
**Note.** This is not an execution plan: it is a **conceptual test** tied to the Context’s vocabulary.

#### F.6:6.6 - M6 - Conclude — *Issue a defensible verdict with confidence*

**Form.**
`evidence E fits Σ(C) ∧ invariants(τ) hold ⊢ holds(κ) with confidence γ ∈ [0,1]`

**Reading.** If observed facts match the expected evidence shape and Template invariants stand, the assignment/status claim **holds** with some confidence (cf. B.3).
**Note.** Confidence combines measurement adequacy (KD‑CAL) with any Context‑specific uncertainty; no Cross‑context boost is implied.

#### F.6:6.7 - Autonomy admission (Green‑Gate) and ledger
* **Before enactment:** If the Method step lists `requiresAutonomyBudget`, the enacting `U.RoleAssignment` **MUST** pass the **Autonomy Green‑Gate**: (i) active/enactable RSG state, (ii) budget tokens/envelope remain in the declared **Γ_time** window, (iii) all guards `pass`.
* **On enactment:** Write an **AutonomyLedgerEntry** attached to the `U.Work`, with deltas and guard verdicts.
* **On depletion:** Block further autonomy‑gated steps; emit a **DepletionNotice** (SpeechAct) and follow the `OverrideProtocolRef`.
* **SoD:** Enforce `⊥` between autonomy consumer Role and override caller Role.

### F.6:7 - Core invariants (normative)

1. **Locality.** Every judgement is **about one context**. No Cross‑context equivalence is presumed or implied (that is F.9’s remit).
2. **Strict splits.** (**a**) **senseFamily split:** **Role** ≠ **Status** (per F.0.1); (**b**) **stance split:** **design** ≠ **run** (A.7). Each judgement names its **senseFamily** and **stance**.
3. **Eligibility before claim.** No binding or status without **eligible(H, τ @ C)**.
4. **Window honesty.** Every claim states or inherits a **Window** consistent with `stance(τ)` and `stance(C)`.
5. **Evidence‑ability.** Every claim must admit at least one **evidence shape** Σ in its Context (KD‑CAL compatible).
6. **Name discipline.** Labels used in judgements follow F.5 (Tech/Plain registers; no Context tags inside names).

### F.6:8 - Reasoning aides (didactic)

* **Context‑prefix speech.** Think and speak with the **Context prefix** when ambiguity lurks: *participant (BPMN)*, *role (RBAC)*, *activity (PROV)*.
* **Window templates.** Prefer short phrases: *“during release‑R3 cutover”*, *“for the Q3 service period”*, *“at 2025‑08‑12T14:30Z”*.
* **Evidence as shape words.** *Result of Observation of ⟨Characteristic⟩ on ⟨Feature⟩ by ⟨Procedure⟩ within W*—not a measurement script.  

**“Assign only what you can later justify by local meaning and observable facts.”**

### F.6:9 - Anti‑patterns & remedies

| #         | Anti‑pattern                   | Symptom                                                                                     | Why it harms reasoning                                                     | Remedy (conceptual move)                                                                                                     |
| --------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AP-1**  | **cross-context Binding**      | A single binding/assertion mixes two Contexts (status/role in C₁ justified by semantics in C₂) without an explicit Bridge. | Violates **Locality**; smuggles a Bridge (kind/CL/Loss) into the claim, making it hard to replay and easy to treat as free substitution. | Re-formulate strictly in one context. If cross-context support is essential, defer to **F.9 Bridge** and keep the assignment/status claim local. |
| **AP‑2**  | **Role/Status Conflation**     | “Operator” modeled as a deontic grant; “SLO met” modeled as a Role.                         | Collapses **behavioural mask** and **epistemic/deontic state** (A.7).      | Re‑type the Template: **Role** for “can/does”, **Status** for “is/has (as a claim)”. Use **M4** accordingly.                 |
| **AP‑3**  | **Window‑less Claims**         | Binding/assertion with no time stance or interval.                                          | Uncheckable; invites retrospective reinterpretation.                       | Make **Window** explicit (§6 M4). Inherit stance from the Context/Template if fixed; otherwise state it.                        |
| **AP‑4**  | **Eligibility‑after‑the‑fact** | Declaring the claim, then back‑fitting eligibility to observed traces.                      | Confuses **necessary conditions** with **diagnostics**; risks circularity. | Perform **M3 Qualify** *before* **M4 Bind/Assert**; treat evidence only in **M5**/**M6**.                                    |
| **AP‑5**  | **Global Label Illusion**      | Using bare labels (“process”, “agent”, “role”) as if universal.                             | Hides the Context; fuels homonym errors.                                      | Always recover **M1 Locate**: `address(τ)=⟨Context, SenseCell⟩`. Use F.5 naming discipline (Tech/Plain registers).              |
| **AP‑6**  | **Evidence by Prestige**       | “Industry practice says …” offered instead of KD‑CAL‑shaped facts.                          | Replaces observable Results with authority talk.                           | State an **evidence shape Σ(Context)** in **M5**; later fill it with **Observation/Result** facts (KD‑CAL).                     |
| **AP‑7**  | **Design/Run Inversion**       | Verifying a design‑time mask by design documents; verifying a run‑status with design specs. | Violates DesignRunTag; yields non‑falsifiable claims.                   | Apply **M2 Stance**: the Template’s stance must be compatible with the Context. Evidence follows the stance.                    |
| **AP-8**  | **Premature Bridge**           | A Bridge is introduced as a shortcut (“align first, then claim”), instead of stating the assignment/status locally and adding a Bridge only when actually needed. | Makes the verdict hostage to an uncertain translation; Bridge Loss and CL penalties leak into the claim and can unnecessarily lower confidence. | Keep the assignment/status claim local; if needed, create an **F.9 Bridge** with loss notes and CL penalty. |
| **AP‑9**  | **Token Proofs**               | Single anecdotal event taken as universal confirmation.                                     | Over‑generalises; ignores evidence windows and procedures.                 | In **M5**, include **Procedure** and **Window**; in **M6**, roll confidence γ from adequacy of sampling (KD‑CAL).            |
| **AP‑10** | **Role Explosion as Patch**    | New Role minted for every exception.                                                        | Name bloat; brittle semantics.                                             | Re‑examine **eligibility** and **Window**; consider a **Status** to mark exceptions instead of new Roles.                    |
| **AP‑11** | **Subject Drift**              | Status asserted on the wrong subject (team vs service; asset vs dataset).                   | Breaks referent clarity; evidence no longer matches.                       | Use **M4**’s split: **plays\_role(H, …)** vs **has\_status(subject(H), …)**; pick the correct subject kind.                  |
| **AP‑12** | **Spec‑in‑Name**               | Cramming constraints into the label (“24x7‑Operator‑With‑Pager”).                           | Names become brittle; invariants become invisible.                         | Keep the label minimal (F.5); move constraints into **eligibility**/**invariants**.                                          |
| **AP‑13** | **Non‑Local Evidence Shape**   | Evidence shape mentions constructs from another Context.                                       | Hidden Cross‑context import.                                                  | Rewrite Σ using only this Context’s vocabulary; if impossible, use **F.9** Bridge and keep Σ local.                             |

### F.6:10 - Worked examples

> Each example is a **context-local** assignment/status reasoning trace using **M1…M6**. cross-context relations, if any, are noted as *optional* bridges (F.9) but not relied upon.

#### F.6:10.1 - Service availability status (ITIL + KD‑CAL)

**Context.** *ITIL 4 (services family; design)*
**Template (Status).* `SLO:availability≥99.9%` anchored at **SenseCell** ⟨ITIL4, “SLO (availability)”⟩.

**M1 Locate.** `address(τ)=⟨ITIL4, SLO(availability)⟩`
**M2 Stance.** `stance(ITIL4)=design`, `stance(τ)=design` ⇒ `compatible_stance(τ, ITIL4)`
**M3 Qualify.** `eligible(Service S, τ@ITIL4)` if S is a published service with declared availability target.
**M4 Assert.** `has_status(S, τ:ITIL4) @ W` where `W = Q1‑2025` (the evaluation period).
**M5 Evidence shape Σ(ITIL4).** *Observation* of **availability characteristic** (MM‑CHR) for S, produced by a **Procedure** that samples uptime and computes the **Result** as ratio over `W`. (KD‑CAL/MM‑CHR terms only; no tool implied.)
**M6 Conclude.** If Results across `W` give ≥ 99.9 % with adequate sampling and declared exclusions applied, `holds( has_status(S, τ:ITIL4) @ W ) with γ≈0.9`.
*Optional bridge.* If uptime sensing vocabulary is expressed in **SOSA/SSN**, an **F.9 Bridge** may map ITIL’s “availability metric” to **ObservableProperty(availability)** with a declared CL penalty; the assignment/status claim itself remains ITIL-local.

#### F.6:10.2 - Behavioural operator role (IEC 61131‑3 + Enactment)

**Context.** *IEC 61131‑3 (control languages; run)*
\**Template (Role).* `Control‑Task‑Executor` anchored at **SenseCell** ⟨IEC61131‑3, “task executes program”⟩.

**M1 Locate.** `address(τ)=⟨IEC61131‑3, task‑execution⟩`
**M2 Stance.** `stance(IEC61131‑3)=run`, `stance(τ)=run` ⇒ compatible.
**M3 Qualify.** Holder `PLC_7` qualifies if it hosts program `P` and is scheduled by task `T`.
**M4 Bind.** `plays_role(PLC_7, τ:IEC) @ W` where `W = [08:00, 18:00] 2025‑06‑05`.
**M5 Evidence shape Σ(IEC).** **Observation** of task schedule and program invocation logs as **Results** for features `T`/`P` during `W`; presence of expected cyclic/event‑driven triggers.
**M6 Conclude.** If Results show the expected executions with no missed cycles beyond tolerance, `holds( plays_role(PLC_7, τ:IEC) @ W ) with γ≈0.8`.
*Trip-wire.* Do **not** restate this as “PROV Activity” without **F.9**; keep the assignment/status claim IEC-local.

#### F.6:10.3 - Dataset accuracy status (ISO/IEC 25024 + KD‑CAL)

**Context.** *ISO/IEC 25024 (data‑quality; design)*
\**Template (Status).* `accuracy≥0.98` anchored at **SenseCell** ⟨ISO25024, “data accuracy”⟩.

**M1 Locate.** `address(τ)=⟨ISO25024, data‑accuracy⟩`
**M2 Stance.** `stance(Context)=design`, `stance(τ)=design` ⇒ compatible.
**M3 Qualify.** Subject `Dataset D` has a defined **reference set** and sampling protocol.
**M4 Assert.** `has_status(D, τ:ISO25024) @ W` where `W = “snapshot v2025‑04”`.
**M5 Evidence shape Σ(ISO25024).** **Observation** of correctness of sampled records vs reference, **Procedure** per standard, **Result** as proportion correct with confidence interval.
**M6 Conclude.** If CI lower bound ≥ 0.98, `holds( has_status(D, τ) @ W ) with γ≈0.85`.

#### F.6:10.4 - Access vs behavioural: two claims, two Contexts

**Contexts.** *NIST RBAC (access; design)* and *BPMN 2.0 (workflow; design)*.
**Templates.** `DB‑Admin (RBAC status)` vs `Participant (BPMN role)`.

**RBAC claim (Status).**
M1…M6 yield `has_status(User U, RBAC:DB‑Admin) @ W_dir` with Σ(RBAC) = **Observation** of assignment state in the access model at time `W_dir`.

**BPMN claim (Role).**
M1…M6 yield `plays_role(Team T, BPMN:Participant) @ W_proc` with Σ(BPMN) = **Observation** that lanes/pools enact tasks during `W_proc`.

**Lesson.** Two separate **context-local** claims — one **Status assertion** and one **Role assignment**; **no** implication that holding RBAC status entails playing the BPMN Role.

### F.6:11 - Relations (with other patterns)

**Builds on:**
F.1 **Domain‑Family Landscape Survey** (Contexts fixed); F.2 **Term Harvesting** (local terms); F.3 **Intra‑Context Clustering** (SenseCells); F.4 **Role Description** (invariants, stance); F.5 **Naming Discipline** (labels).

**Constrains:**
**F.7** (Concept-Set Table): rows reference **SenseCells**; Role Description cards **point to** those rows but never **create** cross-context identity.
**F.8 Mint or Reuse?** Uses outcomes of **Role/Status** claims to decide: a new **Role/Status** label only when existing Templates cannot express the claim with eligibility/Window adjustments.
**F.9** (Alignment & Bridge): any relation across Contexts is **declared there**; Role Description cards remain context-local.
**F.10 Epistemic Status Mapping.** Consumes **M6** confidences γ and Σ‑adequacy to roll up assurance.

**Coordinates with.** **MM‑CHR** (characteristics, scales) wherever *Characteristic/Scale* is used in evidence shapes.

**Used by.**
Patterns (Part C) to anchor their examples: Sys‑CAL (execution/actuation roles), KD‑CAL (measurement statuses), Method‑CAL (execution claims for Methods/MethodDescription), Kind-CAL (typing claims remain outside Role Assignment & Enactment, but may inform eligibility predicates).

### F.6:12 - Migration notes (conceptual)

1. **Template refactor.** If a Template’s invariants change, **claims remain as‑is**; re‑evaluate **M6** on demand. Do not silently rewrite past claims.
2. **Edition updates.** When a Context’s canon updates, treat it as a **new Context** if sense shifts; Claims anchored to the old Context stay valid for their Window.
3. **Name revisions.** Renaming per F.5 does not alter **address(τ)=⟨Context, SenseCell⟩**; claims reference the address, not surface form.
4. **Bridge introduction.** Adding an **F.9 Bridge** never upgrades an existing Role/Status claim; at most it enables *separate* translations with declared loss.
5. **From exception to Status.** If recurring exceptions to a Role appear, prefer minting a **Status** Template that marks the exception rather than proliferating Roles.
6. **Window tightening.** If evidence shows drift, narrow future **Windows**; past claims remain tied to their original Windows.

### F.6:13 - Acceptance tests (SCR/RSCR — concept‑level)

#### F.6:13.1 - Static conformance (SCR)

* **SCR-F6-S01 (Local address).** Every assignment/status claim states `address(τ)=σ` where `σ` is a **SenseCell** (per F.3); no bare labels.
* **SCR‑F6‑S02 (SenseFamily clarity).** Each claim is typed **Role** or **Status**, never both; subjects are of the correct kind. Claim records both **senseFamily** and **stance** explicitly or by inheritance.
* **SCR‑F6‑S03 (Stance compatibility).** `stance(Context)` and `stance(τ)` are compatible (design/run).
* **SCR‑F6‑S04 (Eligibility first).** For each claim, `eligible(H, τ@context)` is derivable prior to assertion.
* **SCR‑F6‑S05 (Window explicit).** Each claim has a Window (explicit or inherited) consistent with stance.
* **SCR‑F6‑S06 (Evidence‑ability).** For each claim, an **evidence shape Σ(Context)** is stated using only that Context’s vocabulary plus KD‑CAL/MM‑CHR primitives.
* **SCR‑F6‑S07 (Locality guard).** No Cross‑context terms appear inside a claim; any reference to other Contexts is flagged as **F.9 Bridge (informative)**, not used to justify the claim.

#### F.6:13.2 - Regression (RSCR)

* **RSCR‑F6‑E01 (Edition stability).** Adding a new edition/Context does not mutate existing claims’ Contexts or Windows.
* **RSCR‑F6‑E02 (Name stability).** Changing labels per F.5 leaves addresses and conclusions invariant.
* **RSCR‑F6‑E03 (Bridge neutrality).** Introducing or revising an **F.9 Bridge** does not auto‑flip claim truth values; at most it enables explicit translations with loss notes.
* **RSCR‑F6‑E04 (Evidence refresh).** When KD‑CAL procedures or **MM‑CHR characteristic scales** change, only **γ** is re‑evaluated; the claim’s semantics remain.

### F.6:14 - Didactic distillation (60‑second recap)

> **Six moves.** (M1) *Locate* the Context & SenseCell; (M2) check **stance**; (M3) test **eligibility**; (M4) **bind/assert** with a **Window**; (M5) sketch the **evidence shape** in that Context; (M6) **conclude** with confidence γ.
> **Two iron rules.** Keep it **context‑local**; keep **Role** and **Status** on their senseFamily.
> **Pay-off.** Assignment/status claims become small, auditable thoughts: easy to teach, easy to check, and easy to relate—later—via explicit Bridges when you truly must step between Contexts.
