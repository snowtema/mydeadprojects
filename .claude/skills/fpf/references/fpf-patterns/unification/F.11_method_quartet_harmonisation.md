## F.11 - Method Quartet Harmonisation

**“Keep the *how* (Method), the *recipe* (MethodDescription), the *happening* (Work/Execution), and the *control push* (Actuation) in their own Contexts—then relate them explicitly.”**

**Status.** Architectural pattern.
**Builds on:** E.10.D1 **D.CTX** (Context discipline); A.3/**A.3.1**/**A.3.2** (Transformer Constitution; `U.Method`, `U.MethodDescription`); A.15/**A.15.1** (`U.Work` as record of occurrence); Sys‑CAL (control/actuation semantics); KD‑CAL (observation).
**Coordinates with.** F.1–F.3 (Contexts, Seeds → SenseCells), F.4 (Role Description), F.5 (Naming), F.6 (Role Assignment & Enactment Cycle (Six-Step)), F.7/F.9 (Bridges), F.10 (Status families & Windows).
**Aliases (informative).** *Method/Spec/Work/Actuation split*; *design/run harmonisation*.


### F.11:1 - Intent & applicability

**Intent.** Provide a **notation‑free, Context‑aware map** that keeps four notions distinct and connectable:

* **`U.Method`** — the abstract **way of doing** (design‑time concept).
* **`U.MethodDescription`** — the **recipe** that describes a Method (epistemic artefact).
* **`U.Work`** (informal: *Execution*) — the **run‑time occurrence** of doing (recorded event).
* **`U.Actuation`** — the **control output** applied to a plant (domain‑specific Work in Sys‑CAL).

The pattern makes the split **usable across FPF patterns** (Role Assignment & Enactment, Sys-CAL, KD-CAL, Kind-CAL, planned LCA-CAL) and **legible across Contexts** (SPEM/BPMN for design; PROV-O/SOSA for run; IEC 61131-3/state-space for control).

**Applicability.** Any time a discussion risks **mixing designs with executions**, **recipes with runs**, or **workflow with control signals**; whenever you need to **name** or **reason** about “how we do X”, “the SOP/script/model”, “the actual run”, or “the actuator push”.

**Non‑goals.** No team workflow, no editors, no tools. No prescriptive file formats. **Only** conceptual distinctions and safe reasoning moves.


### F.11:2 - Problem frame

When Method, MethodDescription, Work, and Actuation **collapse into one another**, models drift:

1. **Design/run blur.** A BPMN *process* (design graph) is cited as if it had *happened*.
2. **Recipe/approval fallacy.** An *approved* SOP (MethodDescription) is treated as proof that the service met its SLO.
3. **Execution ≟ control.** PLC *task execution* logs are conflated with *control outputs* (actuation), hiding stability issues.
4. **Cross‑context homonymy.** *Activity, task, execution, process, command* change sense across Contexts; inferences quietly break.


### F.11:3 - Forces

| Force                        | Tension to resolve                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fidelity vs didactics**    | We must honour domain nuance yet teach a split that fits in working memory.                                    |
| **Universality vs locality** | Quartet must be reusable across FPF patterns, while meanings stay **context‑local**.                             |
| **Evidence vs approval**     | Evidence (run‑time) should support decisions, but must **not** be mistaken for deontic approval (design‑time). |
| **Action vs signal**         | Executing a method is not the same as emitting a control signal; both can co‑occur in one scenario.            |


### F.11:4 - Core idea (didactic)

**Four boxes, four arrows, zero leakage.**

* **Box 1 — Method (design).** The **idea** of how to achieve an effect (algorithm, clinical pathway, welding technique).
* **Box 2 — MethodDescription (design, epistemic).** The **written/encoded recipe** that *describes* a Method (SOP, code, BPMN/SPEM model, theorem‑prover script).
* **Box 3 — Work (run).** The **occurrence** where a System‑in‑Role enacts (some version of) the Method. *`U.Work` is the record of this event.*
* **Box 4 — Actuation (run, Sys‑CAL).** The **control output** (setpoint/command) issued to influence a plant during Work.

**Arrows (conceptual relations).**

* `MethodDescription ↦ Method` (**describes**) — design stance.
* `Work ↦ MethodDescription` (**followedRecipe?** yes/no/variant) — run stance referencing design.
* `Work ↦ Method` (**enacts**) — run stance referencing the abstract way.
* `Actuation ↦ Work` (**part‑of / occurs‑during**) — control output inside execution.

Each box/arrow is **context‑local** (SPEM, PROV‑O, IEC…). **Cross‑context relations use Bridges** (F.7/F.9) with CL/Loss.


### F.11:5 - Minimal vocabulary (this pattern only)

* **Context** = `U.BoundedContext` (per D.CTX).
* **Local‑Sense** → **SenseCell** (F.3): the address *(Context × sense)* for a term like *process*, *task*, *activity*, *command*.
* **Concept‑Set** (F.7/F.8): row aligning multiple SenseCells as “what we regard as the same” (after Bridges & losses are declared).
* **Window** (F.10): temporal/conditional envelope (e.g., *July*, *during test run T42*, *under load ≥ 70%*).
* **StatusCell** (F.10): laddered status **about** methods/specs/works (e.g., *Approved (spec)*; *Observed/Measured (work)*).


### F.11:6 - Solution — the quartet lens (notation‑free)

> *Not steps for a team—**lenses for a thinker**. Use them to sanity‑check any statement about “how”, “script”, “run”, or “signal”.*

#### F.11:6.1 - The **stance split** (design vs run)

* If the claim is about **what should be done** or **how it is described**, you are on the **design stance** (Method/MethodDescription).
* If the claim is about **what happened** or **what was emitted**, you are on the **run stance** (Work/Actuation).
* **Guard rule.** Never let a conclusion cross stances without (a) an explicit Bridge kind (*interpretation* vs *substitution*), and (b) an acceptable CL (F.7/F.9, F.10).

#### F.11:6.2 - The **recipe/idea split**

* **Method** is the **idea**; **MethodDescription** is the **recipe** describing that idea.
* Different recipes may describe the **same** method (profiles, languages, levels of detail); one recipe may encode **several** methods (composite SOP).
* **Naming guard.** Keep labels distinct: *compressive‑strength test* (Method) vs *ASTM C39‑18* (MethodDescription).

#### F.11:6.3 - The **happening** (Work) with **signal** (Actuation)

* **Work** is the **occurrence** (a PROV *Activity*, an IEC *Task* executing a program, a lab run).
* **Actuation** is the **control output** (setpoint, PWM command, valve open %) emitted **during** Work.
* You can have Work **without** Actuation (analysis job), or Actuation **without** a complex Method (manual push). Many scenarios have **both**.

#### F.11:6.4 - The **Role Assignment & Enactment touch-points**

* **Roles** (F.4) bind **who enacts** the Method at run‑time (behavioural masks), **not** what permissions they hold (RBAC is a different Context).
* **Statuses** (F.10) bind to the right box: *Approved* → MethodDescription; *Measured/Observed* → Work; *Satisfied/Violated* → Requirement clause about the Work’s outcomes within a **Window**.


### F.11:7 - Harmonisation map (Context‑first)

> Examples of **local SenseCells** and **safe Bridges**. *You may keep the exact Contexts from your F.1 cut.*

**Design (ideas & recipes).**

* *SPEM/ISO 24744 Context*: `SenseCell{Method}` = *Activity Definition / Task Definition*; `SenseCell{MethodDescription}` = *Process Description / WorkProduct* (as recipe).
* *BPMN 2.0 Context*: `SenseCell{MethodDescription}` = *Process (diagram)* as **design‑time** recipe (do not confuse with run).
* *OWL/Kind-CAL Context*: labels for Method kinds (type taxonomies) when needed (naming, not behaviour).

**Run (occurrences & outputs).**

* *PROV‑O Context*: `SenseCell{Work}` = *Activity* (time‑bounded occurrence).
* *SOSA/SSN Context*: Observations **about** Work results (feeds EvidenceStatus).
* *IEC 61131‑3 Context*: `SenseCell{Work}` = *Task executes Program* (runtime); `SenseCell{Actuation}` = *Output command / setpoint* emitted by the program.

**Typical Bridges (with intent).**

* `BPMN:Process (design)` **≈** `SPEM:Process Definition` (design↔design; CL depends on modelling profile; Loss: expressiveness gaps).
* `IEC:Task execution` **⊑** `PROV:Activity` (run↔run; Loss: control‑specific timing semantics, scan cycles).
* `Actuation (IEC)` **⋂** `Activity (PROV)` (intersection: the *sub‑intervals* where outputs are emitted).
* `SOSA:Observation` **interprets** `Requirement clause` (F.10) about **Work outcomes** (**cross‑StatusModality: epistemic→deontic; never substitution**; declare **Bridge(kind=Interpretation, CL, Loss)**).


### F.11:8 - Invariants (normative)

1. **DesignRunTag honesty.** Statements about **Method/MethodDescription** (design) **MUST NOT** be used as if they were statements about **Work/Actuation** (run) without an explicit Bridge and Window.
2. **Box discipline.** Every claim about “how”, “recipe”, “run”, or “control output” **MUST** point to the correct box in the quartet.
3. **Context locality.** Terms (*process*, *activity*, *task*, *command*) **MUST** be read as **SenseCells** in their Contexts (F.3); Cross‑context equivalence is a matter for F.7/F.9 Bridges.
4. **Status placement.** *Approved* attaches to MethodDescription; *Observed/Measured* attach to Work; *Satisfied/Violated* attach to clauses about Work outcomes within a **Window** (F.10).
5. **Actuation as Work‑part.** Actuation **MUST** be modelled as **occurring within** (or as a specialised form of) Work on the run stance; it does **not** replace Work.
6. **Naming clarity.** Technical/Plain labels for the quartet **SHOULD** be distinct (F.5); avoid homonymous single‑word labels when Contexts collide.
7. **Bridge guard.** Cross‑context moves **MUST** declare **kind** (≈, ⊑, ⊒, ⋂, ⊥, Interpretation), **CL**, and **Loss** (F.7/F.9).


### F.11:9 - Micro‑examples (didactic)

1. **Data pipeline deploy (software).**
   *Method*: “Delta‑load transform”. *MethodDescription*: `etl_delta.py@v3`. *Work*: nightly run 2025‑07‑14. *Actuation*: none.
   *Statuses*: Spec **Approved** (governance Context); Work **Measured** (rows processed) → Evidence for SLO (F.10).

2. **Valve control (industrial).**
   *Method*: PID tuning heuristic. *MethodDescription*: SOP sheet + IEC program. *Work*: PLC task cycle 18:00–18:30. *Actuation*: PWM duty sequence.
   *Bridge*: `IEC:Task` ⊑ `PROV:Activity` (CL=2). Observed setpoint tracking **interprets** requirement “settling time ≤ 5 s”.

3. **Clinical assay (lab).**
   *Method*: ELISA. *MethodDescription*: Kit IFU v7. *Work*: run batch #B217. *Actuation*: pipetting robot commands.
   *Statuses*: Spec **Approved** ≠ batch **Satisfied** (requires evidence at batch Window).

### F.11:10 - Anti‑patterns & remedies

| #       | Anti‑pattern                   | Symptom in prose/models                                               | Why it harms thinking                                                       | Remedy (conceptual move)                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A1**  | **Design→Run Substitution**    | “The process **achieved** X” while pointing to a design diagram.      | Treats a **MethodDescription** as if it were **Work**; collapses stances.           | Apply the **stance split**: restate as “The **diagram describes** how X **should** be achieved.” To claim it **happened**, reference a **Work** SenseCell in a run‑time Context and, if needed, add a **Window** (F.10). |
| **A2**  | **Approval = Evidence**        | “Approved SOP ⇒ requirement satisfied.”                               | A **StatusCell** about a **MethodDescription** does not entail a run‑time outcome. | Keep **Approved** on Spec; place **Satisfied/Violated** on clauses **about Work** within a **Window**; require Observation/Evidence (KD‑CAL) for the run side.                                                       |
| **A3**  | **Execution = Actuation**      | PLC log of setpoints recorded as the whole execution history.         | Loses non‑signal aspects (delays, conditions, context); weakens reasoning.  | Model **Actuation** as **within** **Work**. Keep both SenseCells: *Task execution* (Work) and *Command/Setpoint* (Actuation).                                                                                        |
| **A4**  | **BPMN‑as‑Run**                | BPMN *Process* treated as “the thing that ran.”                       | BPMN’s meaning is context‑local and design‑time.                               | Use a **Bridge** (F.7/F.9) from *BPMN\:Process (design)* → *PROV\:Activity (run)* with kind **Interpretation**, CL/Loss declared.                                                                                    |
| **A5**  | **Spec Drift Retroactivity**   | Update to a recipe is assumed to modify past executions.              | Violates temporal honesty; breaks auditability.                             | Past **Work** remains as‑was. New **MethodDescription** versions describe future **Work** only; record variant relations if a run deviated.                                                                                 |
| **A6**  | **Homonym Collapse**           | *Task*, *activity*, *process* used interchangeably across Contexts.      | Imports meaning implicitly; masks losses.                                   | Prefix with **Context** and use **SenseCells**: e.g., *task (IEC)*, *activity (PROV)*, *process (BPMN)*. Any relation uses **Bridges** with CL/Loss.                                                                    |
| **A7**  | **Signal‑Only Compliance**     | SLO judged solely from actuator traces.                               | Ignores measured outcomes; risks false positives.                           | Tie **SLO** clauses to **Observations** (KD‑CAL) **about Work outcomes**; treat Actuation as an input, not proof.                                                                                                    |
| **A8**  | **Recipe-as-Role**             | “The Spec assigns responsibility” (mixes MethodDescription with Role constructs — `U.RoleDescription`/`U.RoleAssignment`).  | Conflates epistemic artefact with behavioural masks.                        | Use **F.4 Role Description; let **MethodDescription** only **describe** a Method.                                                                              |
| **A9**  | **One‑Context Scope**        | A single Context (e.g., BPMN) used as if it covered control/measurement. | Scope mirage; silent cross‑domain generalisation.                           | Re‑cut Contexts (F.1) to include control and sensing. Re‑express statements with the quartet across those Contexts.                                                                                                        |
| **A10** | **Lossless Bridge Assumption** | Claiming “equivalent” across Contexts without Loss.                      | Hides mismatches; unsafe transfer of inferences.                            | In **F.7/F.9** declare Bridge **kind**, **CL**, and explicit **Loss** notes.                                                                                                                                         |
| **A11** | **Recipe‑as‑Type**             | Treating a MethodDescription vocabulary as a type taxonomy.                  | Category error; misuses Kind-CAL.                                           | If a stable hierarchy of **kinds** of Methods is needed, mint **U.Type** nodes in Kind-CAL; keep MethodDescription as *description* only.                                                                                   |
| **A12** | **Actuation Outside Work**     | Commands modeled without enclosing Work.                              | Severs signal from enactment context; breaks traceability.                  | Embed **Actuation** **within** **Work** intervals; relate to the enacting Role and Method/MethodDescription references.                                                                                                     |


### F.11:11 - Worked examples (extended)

> Each scenario names Contexts (from your F.1 cut), identifies the quartet boxes, and shows safe Cross‑context moves.

#### F.11:11.1 - ML service rollout (software + services + sensing)

* **Contexts:** *SPEM/ISO 24744* (design), *PROV‑O* (run), *SOSA/SSN* (sensing), *ITIL 4* (services).
* **Quartet:**

  * **Method:** *Canary deployment strategy*.
  * **MethodDescription:** *Canary plan document with traffic slices and rollback rules* (design Context).
  * **Work:** *Two canary runs 2025‑08‑02 10:00–12:00* (PROV‑Activities).
  * **Actuation:** *Traffic‑shifting commands* (if modeled, they are outputs inside Work; optional in pure software).
* **Statuses (F.10):** *Spec Approved*; *Work Observed* (latency/err‑rate via SOSA Observations); *SLO clause Satisfied* in Window if measured ≤ thresholds.
* **Bridge(s):** *BPMN (if used) Process (design)* → *PROV Activity (run)* **Interpretation**, CL=2, **Loss:** path vs time granularity.

**Pay‑off:** No one infers SLO satisfaction from a plan. Evidence is about **Work**; the plan stays design‑time.


#### F.11:11.2 - Industrial furnace control (control + sensing + services)

* **Contexts:** *State‑space control texts* (design), *IEC 61131‑3* (run), *PROV‑O* (run), *SOSA/SSN* (sensing), *ITIL 4* (services).
* **Quartet:**

  * **Method:** *PID with feed‑forward*.
  * **MethodDescription:** *Controller tuning sheet + program description*.
  * **Work:** *PLC task cycles 14:00–14:30* (IEC *Task executes Program*), **Bridged** as **PROV Activity**.
  * **Actuation:** *Setpoint & valve duty cycle outputs* emitted during Work.
* **Statuses:** *Spec Approved*; *Work Observed* (temperature curve); requirement *settling time ≤ 5 s* **Satisfied** if the observation within Window meets it.
* **Bridge(s):** `IEC:Task` ⊑ `PROV:Activity` (CL=2, **Loss:** scan‑cycle semantics). `SOSA:Observation` **interprets** requirement clause (CL=3).

**Pay‑off:** Separates **doing** from **pushing**, and both from **measuring**; compliance judged where it belongs.


#### F.11:11.3 - Clinical assay

* **Contexts:** *SPEM/ISO 24744* (design), *Lab assay canon* (design/run split as per discipline), *PROV‑O* (run), *SOSA/SSN* (sensing).
* **Quartet:**

  * **Method:** *ELISA*.
  * **MethodDescription:** *Kit IFU v7 (instructions for use)*.
  * **Work:** *Batch B217 performed 2025‑06‑21* (PROV Activity).
  * **Actuation:** *Pipetting robot commands* (optional detail).
* **Statuses:** *Spec Approved*; *Work Observed* (absorbance readings); *Quality gate Satisfied* within batch Window.
* **Bridge(s):** IFU (design) **interprets** Activity (run) for acceptance (CL=2, **Loss:** deviations allowed per kit tolerances).

**Pay‑off:** A clean line from recipe → run → measurement → decision, without role/status conflation.


#### F.11:11.4 Incident response (services + enactment)

* **Contexts:** *ITIL 4* (services/design), *BPMN 2.0* (design), *PROV‑O* (run).
* **Quartet:**

  * **Method:** *Triage‑first incident handling*.
  * **MethodDescription:** *Incident workflow diagram + playbook*.
  * **Work:** *Handling INC‑3421, 09:10–10:02* (PROV Activity).
  * **Actuation:** none (unless modeling command invocations as outputs).
* **Statuses:** *Spec Approved*; *Work Observed* (timestamps, response time); *SLO “MTTR ≤ 60 min”* **Satisfied** within the incident Window.
* **Bridge(s):** BPMN (design) → PROV (run) **Interpretation**, CL=2, **Loss:** gateways vs real‑time branching.

**Pay‑off:** MTTR claims are tied to **Work**, not to the playbook.


### F.11:12 - Reasoning primitives (judgement schemas)

> Pure **mental moves**; no storage or workflow is implied.

1. **Box classifier**
   `statement s, Contexts fixed ⊢ box(s) ∈ {Method, MethodDescription, Work, Actuation}`
   *Reading:* Classify any claim by its **box** (design idea, design recipe, run occurrence, control output).

2. **Stance firewall**
   `box(s) ∈ {Method,MethodDescription} ⊢ s ∉ {claims about Work outcomes}`
   *Reading:* A design‑time (stance) statement does **not** assert a run‑time (stance) outcome.

3. **Followed‑recipe judgement**
   `Work w, MethodDescription m ⊢ follows(w,m) ∈ {exact, variant, none}`
   *Reading:* A Work may follow a recipe **exactly**, with a **variant**, or **not at all**; later inferences must respect this value.

4. **Enactment link**
   `Work w, Method h ⊢ enacts(w,h)`
   *Reading:* The occurrence enacts the abstract Method (even if several specs describe it).

5. **Actuation inclusion**
   `Actuation a, Work w ⊢ occursWithin(a,w)`
   *Reading:* Control outputs are **within** (or are parts of) a Work interval.

6. **Observation binding** (KD‑CAL handshake)
   `Observation o about outcome(x) during Window W of Work w ⊢ evidenceFor(w, clause(x,W))`
   *Reading:* Measurements about a Work outcome within a Window serve as evidence for clauses **about that Work**.

7. **Clause evaluation** (F.10 handshake)
   `evidenceFor(w,clause) ⊢ status(clause,w) ∈ {Satisfied, Violated, Inconclusive}`
   *Reading:* A clause about Work yields a status via the observation set.

8. **Context locality**
   `term t, Context C ⊢ meaning(t)@C is local`
   *Reading:* A term’s sense is **local** to its Context; Cross‑context claims require Bridges.

9. **Bridge application** (F.7/F.9)
   `Bridge B: (X@A) ~kind,CL,Loss~ (Y@B); fact about X ⊢ transferableTo(Y) with penalty(CL,Loss)`
   *Reading:* Facts may transfer across Contexts only along a declared Bridge, with the stated penalty.

10. **Version non‑retroactivity**
    `MethodDescription m updated → m' ⊢ ∀ past Work w: follows(w,m')=none (unless w references m')`
    *Reading:* New recipes don’t rewrite history.

11. **Composite reasoning**
    `MethodDescription m = m1 ; m2, Work w executes steps w1,w2 ⊢ enacts(w1,m1) ∧ enacts(w2,m2)`
    *Reading:* Composition on design does not force composition on run, but when it aligns you may relate sub‑runs to sub‑methods.

12. **SLO locus guard**
    `SLO clause about service outcome ⊢ attachesTo(Work-window), not MethodDescription`
    *Reading:* Service obligations concern **what happened** within a Window, not the existence of a plan.


### F.11:13 - Relations

**Builds on:**
E.10.D1 **D.CTX** (Context ≡ `U.BoundedContext`); A.3/**A.3.1**/**A.3.2**/**A.15** (Method/Spec/Work foundations); Sys‑CAL (Actuation semantics); KD‑CAL (Observation); F.1–F.3 (Contexts → SenseCells); F.10 (Status families & Windows).

**Constrains:**

* **F.4 Role Description:** Roles/Statuses **must** point to the right box (e.g., *Approved* → MethodDescription; *Observed* → Work).
* **F.5 Naming:** Enforce distinct Tech/Plain labels for Method/Spec/Work/Actuation where homonyms threaten.
* **F.7/F.9 Bridges:** All Cross‑context assertions among quartet terms **must** go through explicit Bridges with **kind/CL/Loss**.

**Used by.**
Part C patterns (Sys‑CAL, KD‑CAL, Method‑CAL, Kind-CAL, LCA‑CAL) when describing examples, proofs, and cross‑disciplinary mappings.


### F.11:14 - Migration notes (conceptual)

1. **Split conflated “process”.** Where a single “process” node stands for both plan and run, refactor into **MethodDescription** (design) and **Work** (run); add a Bridge if the prose relied on identity.
2. **Re‑home statuses.** Move any *Approval*‑like statuses from Work to MethodDescription; move *Satisfied/Violated* from Spec to clauses about Work within **Windows**.
3. **Expose actuation.** If control outputs are buried in “execution logs,” mint **Actuation** SenseCells and relate them **within** Work.
4. **Version fences.** Past Works keep references to the **version** of MethodDescription they attempted to follow; don’t update those links retroactively.
5. **Name collisions.** Where *task/activity/process* appear with mixed meanings, prefix with Contexts and relabel per **F.5** (Tech/Plain).
6. **Backfill Bridges.** If earlier text implied Cross‑context equivalence, add explicit Bridges (F.7/F.9) declaring **kind/CL/Loss**.


### F.11:15 - Acceptance tests (SCR/RSCR — concept level)

#### F.11:15.1 - Static conformance checks (SCR)

* **SCR‑F11‑S01 (DesignRunTag honesty).** Every normative claim about outcomes is attached to **Work** (with Window), not to **Method/MethodDescription**.
* **SCR‑F11‑S02 (Box placement).** Labels and statuses appear on the correct box (e.g., *Approved* on MethodDescription only).
* **SCR‑F11‑S03 (Actuation inclusion).** All Actuation statements are modeled as **within** a Work interval.
* **SCR‑F11‑S04 (Context discipline).** Each quartet term is expressed as a **SenseCell** with its Context; no Cross‑context identity is asserted here.
* **SCR‑F11‑S05 (Bridge guard).** Any Cross‑context reasoning among quartet terms references an explicit **Bridge** with **kind/CL/Loss**.

#### F.11:15.2 - Regression checks (RSCR)

* **RSCR‑F11‑E01 (Spec update).** When a MethodDescription changes, previous Works remain valid and unchanged; their statuses don’t shift unless re‑evaluated with explicit rationale.
* **RSCR‑F11‑E02 (Bridge drift).** If a Context updates, revisit Bridges that touch quartet terms; adjust **CL/Loss** only via F.7/F.9.
* **RSCR‑F11‑E03 (Status drift).** Adding new statuses does not move them across boxes (e.g., no new “Work‑Approved”).
* **RSCR‑F11‑E04 (Signal creep).** Introducing new Actuation details does not erase or replace Work context.


### F.11:16 - Didactic distillation (90‑second script)

> “When you talk about *how something is done*, decide which of the **four boxes** you mean.
> **Method** is the **idea** (the way). **MethodDescription** is the **recipe** (the description). **Work** is the **happening** (what actually occurred). **Actuation** is the **control push** (signals emitted during Work).
> Keep **design** and **run** as distinct **stances**. Plans and approvals live in the **design stance**; measurements and obligations live in the **run stance** within **Windows**.
> Words like *process*, *task*, *activity*, *command* are **context‑local**—say *process (BPMN)*, *activity (PROV)*, *task (IEC)*. If you must relate them, draw a **Bridge** and declare its **kind**, **CL**, and **Loss**.
> For compliance, don’t point at the plan—point at **Work**, show **Observations**, and judge clauses in **F.10**.
> Hold this quartet in your head and you’ll stop mixing plans with facts, signals with outcomes, and names across Contexts. + Everything else—naming (F.5), `U.RoleDescription` (F.4) and `U.RoleAssignment`/`U.RoleEnactment` (A.2.1/F.6), Bridges (F.7/F.9)—falls into place.
