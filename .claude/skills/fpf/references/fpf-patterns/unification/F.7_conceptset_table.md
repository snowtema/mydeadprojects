## F.7 - Concept‑Set Table

**“Show one thing across Contexts—only where explicit bridges allow it.”**

**Status.** Architectural pattern.
**Depends on.** E.10.D1 **Lexical Discipline for ‘Context’** (Context ≡ `U.BoundedContext`); **F.0.1 senseFamily (normative)**; F.1 **Domain‑Family Landscape Survey**; F.2 **Term Harvesting**; F.3 **Intra‑Context Sense Clustering** (SenseCells); F.5 **Naming Discipline**; F.9 **Alignment & Bridge Across Contexts**.
**Coordinates with.** F.4 **Role Description**; F.6 **Role Assignment & Enactment Cycle (Six-Step)**; Part C patterns (for examples), **MM‑CHR (for Characteristic)**; A.6.9 (RPR‑XCTX for repairing umbrella cross‑Context sameness/alignment prose before it justifies rows).
**Aliases (informative).** *Concept‑Set table*, *comparison grid*.

### F.7:1 - Intent & applicability

**Intent.** Provide a **single, didactic page** where each **row** presents **one Concept‑Set**—a *set of SenseCells from different Contexts that we are licensed (by explicit Bridges) to treat as “the same for a stated scope”*. Columns are **Contexts**; cells carry **local labels**. The table **does not invent equivalences**: it **summarises** already declared **F.9 Bridges**, exposing *scope, losses, and counter‑examples* at a glance.

**Applicability.** Use whenever cross-context reading is necessary (naming U.Types, teaching contrasts, assignment/enactment-adjacent terminology). It is a **reading lens**, not a data model: **notation-free**, **governance-free**, **Context-loyal**.

**Non‑goals.** No hidden merges. No “global terms”. No workflows or tool schemas. The table is a **conceptual display** of *licensed sameness* and *honest non‑sameness*.


### F.7:2 - Problem frame

Without a disciplined Cross‑context view:

1. **Silent equivalence.** Readers assume sameness by name alone (e.g., *process*).
2. **Loss denial.** Mappings hide what is dropped (DesignRunTag, units, agency).
3. **Name inflation.** New U.Types are coined to avoid facing heterogeneity.
4. **Cognitive scatter.** Concepts drift across documents without one compact, teachable “where‑what‑how‑same” view.


### F.7:3 - Forces

| Force                          | Tension to resolve                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Locality vs comparison**     | Meaning lives in Contexts; yet we must **compare** Contexts to reason across disciplines.                           |
| **Didactics vs fidelity**      | A compact row is easy to grasp; it must still show **scope and loss** honestly.                               |
| **Simplicity vs completeness** | A minimal grid aids memory; temptation to overload it with proofs and procedures must be resisted.            |
| **Sameness vs difference**     | Some families **cannot** be unified; the table must support **contrast rows** without pretending equivalence. |


### F.7:4 - Core idea (didactic)

A **Concept‑Set** is a **finite set of addresses**

$$
\text{CS}=\{\langle \text{Context}_i,\ \text{SenseCell}_i\rangle\}_{i=1..n}
$$

that FPF **treats as one** *for a declared scope* because there exist **F.9 Bridges** connecting these SenseCells pairwise (directly or via a short chain) with **congruence level** $\text{CL}$ above a **threshold** suitable for that scope. The **table row** shows:

* **FPF Label** *(Tech/Plain)* — the *didactic, FPF‑level* name chosen per F.5.
* **Row Scope** — where “being one” is safe (e.g., *Naming-only*, *assignment/enactment-eligibility*, *KD-CAL metric*, *Type‑structure*).
* **Row CL(min)** — the **minimum CL** of the Bridges that justify the row.
* **Context columns** — each cell: the **local label** + (optional) short cue.
* **Rationale (one line)** — why sameness is warranted *for this scope*.
* **Counter‑examples (one line)** — where/why sameness **breaks**.

> **Memory hook.** *A Concept‑Set row is a promise:* “You may **read across** these Contexts **this far—and no farther**.”


### F.7:5 - Minimal vocabulary (this pattern only)

* **Context** — shorthand for `U.BoundedContext` (per E.10.D1).
* **senseFamily** — **referenced from F.0.1**; not redefined here; used to **type** rows and to require **uniformity** within a row.
* **SenseCell** — a **(Context × Local‑Sense)** address from F.3.
* **Bridge (F.9)** — an explicit, declarative Cross‑context mapping with a **congruence level** **CL** and **loss note**.
* **Characteristic (MM‑CHR)** — measurable comparandum defined in **MM‑CHR**; may be referenced in **Measurement/KD‑metric** rows; **do not** use “axis” only as a euphemism.
* **Concept‑Set (row)** — a *licensed sameness* across Contexts, bounded by **Row Scope** and **Row CL(min)**.
* **Contrast row** — a *non‑sameness* row: same surface across Contexts with **no** sufficient Bridges; teaches **difference**, not unity.


### F.7:6 - The table (conceptual layout)

> One page. Fixed column order by Context. Each row fits in **five lines** max.

```
FPF Label (Tech / Plain) | Row Scope | Row CL(min) | [Context A] local label | [Context B] local label | [Context C] local label | Rationale | Counter‑examples
```

**Reading rules (didactic):**

1. **Cells are local.** A cell is **not** a translation; it is the Context’s **own** label for its SenseCell.
2. **Scope is king.** The FPF label only licenses sameness **within its Row Scope**. Outside that scope, treat cells as **different**.
3. **Row CL(min) governs trust.** Lower CL ⇒ narrower applicability; **never** up‑scope a row without revisiting Bridges.
4. **Rationale & counter‑examples** are **obligatory one‑liners**; if you need paragraphs, you need an F.9 walkthrough, not a row.

**Didactic name rationale** “Giants' table’” that alludes to *standing on the shoulders of giants*: each row explicitly leans on authoritative context of meaning (**U.BoundedContext**) established by prior disciplines and not imagined. It does **not** mean a physically large table; the name signals epistemic humility and traceable reliance on those sources. "We are like dwarfs on the shoulders of giants, so that we can see more than they, and things at a greater distance, not by virtue of any sharpness of sight on our part, or any physical distinction, but because we are carried high and raised up by their giant size." by Bernard of Chartres , d. c.1130, French philosopher.

### F.7:7 - Conceptual construction (thought moves, not workflow)

> The table is derived from earlier patterns; it **creates nothing new**.

* **Sourcing.** Candidate cells come **only** from **SenseCells** (F.3).
* **Licensing.** A row exists **iff** the relevant **Bridges (F.9)** already justify sameness at the chosen **Row Scope**.
* **Bounding.** Prefer **2–4 Contexts** per row (parsimony); add more only if each adds a *distinct necessity* for the sameness claim.
* **Typing.** A row is **typed by senseFamily**: Role, Status, Type‑structure, Measurement, etc. **Do not mix senseFamilies** in one row.
* **Temporal honesty.** A row’s cells must share **compatible DesignRunTag**; if not, either split into two rows or mark a **contrast row**.


### F.7:8 - Invariants (normative)

1. **Context‑loyal cells.** Every non‑empty cell is a **SenseCell** address; no minted paraphrases.
2. **Bridge sufficiency.** For a *Concept‑Set* row, **every pair** of filled cells is connected by an **F.9 Bridge path** whose **bottleneck CL** ≥ **Row CL(min)** printed for the row.
3. **Scope declaration.** Each row **MUST** declare a **Row Scope** chosen from a small controlled set (e.g., *Naming-only*, *assignment/enactment-eligibility*, *KD-metric*, *Type-structure*).
4. **senseFamily uniformity.** All cells in a row belong to the **same senseFamily** (Role **or** Status **or** Type-structure **or** Measurement…).
5. **Temporal compatibility.** Either all cells share the **same stance**, or the row is a **contrast row** (no sameness claim).
6. **Loss disclosure.** If any Bridge in the row has a **loss note**, the row **MUST** include a **counter‑example** that illustrates that loss in one line.
7. **No stealth expansion.** Adding a new cell to a row **MUST NOT** lower the printed **Row CL(min)** without updating **Row Scope** or splitting the row.
8. **Parsimony.** A row with only one filled cell is **forbidden** (that would be local talk, not a Cross‑context concept).
9. **Didactic bound.** A row that cannot be read in **≤ 30 seconds** violates didactic primacy and must be split.


### F.7:9 - Micro‑illustrations (safe patterns)

> Illustrative only; these presume corresponding **F.9 Bridges** exist with stated CL and losses.

**(a) Subtyping across type‑formalisms (Type‑structure row)**

| FPF Label                                  | Row Scope      | Row CL(min) | OWL 2             | Kind-CAL            | Rationale                                                        | Counter‑examples                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------- | ----------- | ----------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **is‑a (Tech)** / *type hierarchy* (Plain) | Type‑structure | CL = 3      | `rdfs:subClassOf` | `U.SubtypeRelation` | Both are partial‑order *class* subsumption used for inheritance. | FCA *concept* order is not a class subsumption; keep it out or CL drops. |

**(b) “Observation result value” (Measurement row)**

| FPF Label                           | Row Scope | Row CL(min) | SOSA/SSN                | ISO 80000‑1                    | ITIL 4                       | Rationale                                                                                           | Counter‑examples                                                |
| ----------------------------------- | --------- | ----------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **result‑value** / *measured value* | KD‑metric | CL = 2      | `sosa:Result` (literal) | `QuantityValue` (unit‑bearing) | *metric value* (service KPI) | Values can be read as numbers tied to a Characteristic; ITIL metric uses same notion when unitised. | ITIL “metric” may be composite indices (loss of unit fidelity). |

**(c) Contrast row: “process” (no sameness)**

| FPF Label              | Row Scope | Row CL(min) | BPMN 2.0              | PROV‑O                  | Thermodynamics           | Rationale                                                 | Counter‑examples                                                                   |
| ---------------------- | --------- | ----------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **process** (contrast) | —         | —           | *graph of flow nodes* | *time‑bounded activity* | *state‑space trajectory* | Same surface, **different** senses; no licensed sameness. | Any attempt to equate design‑graph with run‑occurrence fails stance compatibility. |


### F.7:10 - Anti‑patterns & remedies

| #         | Anti‑pattern                | Symptom in a row                                                               | Why it breaks thinking                                               | Remedy (conceptual move)                                                                                          |
| --------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AP‑1**  | **Bridge‑free sameness**    | Cells listed as “same” because their labels look alike; no cited Bridges.      | Violates locality; imports meaning across Contexts by name.             | A row **exists only** if backed by **F.9 Bridges**. Otherwise produce a **contrast row**.                         |
| **AP-2**  | **Scope creep**             | Row labelled “Type-structure” but used to justify **assignment/enactment-eligibility** or KD metrics. | Scope licences are not transferable; inference leaks.                | Keep a **small controlled set of Row Scopes**. If use widens, **mint a new row** or **re-bridge** with higher CL. |
| **AP‑3**  | **senseFamily mixing**      | One row mixes Role, Status, Measurement, and Type‑structure cells.             | Conflates senseFamily (F.0.1); readers cannot tell “what kind of sameness”. | **Type each row.** If two senseFamilys are needed, **split** into two rows.                                             |
| **AP‑4**  | **Temporal blur**           | Cells with incompatible DesignRunTag declared “same”.                     | Design artefacts ≠ run occurrences; claims invert.                   | Either **harmonise stance** (choose only compatible cells) or publish a **contrast row**.                         |
| **AP‑5**  | **Loss denial**             | Bridges carry loss notes, but the row omits counter‑examples.                  | Readers over‑trust; misuse outside safe scope.                       | Add a **one‑line counter‑example** that illustrates the loss.                                                     |
| **AP‑6**  | **CL averaging**            | Row CL(min) computed as an average of heterogeneous Bridges.                   | The weakest link governs; averages overstate safety.                 | Row CL(min) is the **bottleneck** (minimum along connecting paths).                                               |
| **AP‑7**  | **Overwide rows**           | 6–8 Contexts in one row; hard to read; subtle mismatches hide.                    | Violates didactic primacy; invites hidden losses.                    | **Parsimony**: 2–4 Contexts per row unless each extra cell has a **distinct necessity** you can state in one line.   |
| **AP‑8**  | **Minted paraphrases**      | Cells reword a Context’s label instead of citing the SenseCell.                   | Hides locality; future drift becomes invisible.                      | **Cells are Context‑loyal.** Use the Context’s own SenseCell label.                                                     |
| **AP‑9**  | **Duplicate rows by style** | Two rows with the same cell set but different FPF labels.                      | Name inflation; readers assume two distinct concepts.                | Keep **one row** per Concept‑Set per scope. Alternative labels appear as **aliases** in F.5, not new rows.        |
| **AP‑10** | **Implied transitivity**    | A↔B and B↔C Bridges exist; row silently assumes A↔C at the same CL.            | Paths can reduce CL; semantics might not compose.                    | Compute CL for **A↔C via bottleneck**; if too low, either reduce **Row Scope** or **omit** the cell.              |


### F.7:11 - Worked examples

> Each example gives a **row** (compact), then a **reading** explaining scope and limits. All sameness claims presuppose suitable **F.9 Bridges** with the stated CL.

#### F.7:11.1 - Behavioural actor across Contexts (naming‑only)

| FPF Label (Tech / Plain)              | Row Scope   | Row CL(min) | BPMN 2.0        | PROV‑O    | Rationale                                                                               | Counter‑examples                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- | --------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **actor** / *party that participates* | Naming‑only | CL = 2      | **Participant** | **Agent** | Both denote a bearer that can be named as the party to which activities are attributed. | PROV **Agent** includes software agents; BPMN **Participant** is typically an organisation lane/pool. |

**Reading.** The row licenses a **glossary‑level sameness** for didactic prose (“the actor”). It does **not** license modelling **identity** or inference across Contexts.


#### F.7:11.2 - Execution occurrence (assignment/enactment-eligibility)

| FPF Label                                       | Row Scope       | Row CL(min) | PROV‑O                                                           | IEC 61131‑3                                          | Rationale                                                                       | Counter‑examples                                                   |
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **execution-occurrence** / *a run that happens* | assignment/enactment-eligibility | CL = 2      | **Activity** (time-bounded occurrence using/generating entities) | **Task execution** (cyclic/event-driven program run) | Both are **run-time** occurrences that can be referenced by `U.RoleEnactment` to ground **Work performed under an assignment**. | BPMN **Process** is a **design** graph; not an occurrence—exclude. |

**Reading.** Safe to use as the **run-time occurrence that `U.RoleEnactment` points to** when we say “this Work was performed under an assignment”. Not safe to equate **all** PROV Activities with **all** PLC task runs for analytics.


#### F.7:11.3 - Result value as KD‑metric (measurement)

| FPF Label                           | Row Scope | Row CL(min) | SOSA/SSN             | ISO 80000‑1                      | ITIL 4           | Rationale                                                                                                | Counter‑examples                                               |
| ----------------------------------- | --------- | ----------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **result‑value** / *measured value* | KD‑metric | CL = 2      | **Result** (literal) | **QuantityValue** (unit‑bearing) | **metric value** | A number representing a **Characteristic** at observation time; can be unitised and compared to targets. | ITIL “metric” may be a composite index; units may be implicit. |

**Reading.** Licences **metric tables** that join observations to service targets; warns that composite KPIs may violate unit fidelity.


#### F.7:11.4 - Subtype relation (type‑structure)

| FPF Label                   | Row Scope      | Row CL(min) | OWL 2             | Kind-CAL            | Rationale                                     | Counter‑examples                                                                 |
| --------------------------- | -------------- | ----------- | ----------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **is‑a** / *type hierarchy* | Type‑structure | CL = 3      | `rdfs:subClassOf` | `U.SubtypeRelation` | Both are partial orders used for inheritance. | FCA **concept order** is not a class subsumption—exclude or publish another row. |


#### F.7:11.5 - Contrast: “role” (access vs behaviour)

| FPF Label           | Row Scope | Row CL(min) | NIST RBAC                 | BPMN 2.0                                 | Rationale                                                      | Counter‑examples                                                                   |
| ------------------- | --------- | ----------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **role** (contrast) | —         | —           | **Role** (permission set) | **Participant/Actor** (behavioural mask) | Same surface; **different senseFamilys** (Status vs Role/behaviour). | Any attempt to unify collapses deontics into behaviour; stance and effects differ. |

**Reading.** This row **teaches difference**; it deliberately **does not** license sameness.


### F.7:12 - Reasoning primitives (judgement schemas, notation‑free)

> All judgements are **pure** (no side effects). “Contexts” are `U.BoundedContext`. `SC(C)` denotes a SenseCell in Context `C`. `CL(X↔Y)` is the congruence level of the **best** Bridge path (F.9) between SenseCells `X` and `Y` (bottleneck along that path).

#### F.7:12.1 - Row licensing

**Form.**
`S = {SC(C₁), …, SC(Cₙ)}, Scope = s, τ(s) = requiredCL ⊢ licensable(S,s) ⇔ (∀ i<j: CL(SC(Cᵢ)↔SC(Cⱼ)) ≥ requiredCL ∧ senseFamily (S) is uniform ∧ stance(S) compatible)`

**Reading.** A set of cells **licenses** a row of scope `s` iff every pair is bridged at or above the **required CL** for that scope, all cells sit in the **same senseFamily**, and **DesignRunTag** is compatible.


#### F.7:12.2 - Bottleneck CL for a row

**Form.**
`RowCL(S) = min_{i<j} CL(SC(Cᵢ)↔SC(Cⱼ))`

**Reading.** The row’s CL is the **minimum** congruence level across all pairs (the weakest link).


#### F.7:12.3 - Scope guard

**Form.**
`licensable(S,s) ∧ s ⊑ s' ⊢ licensable(S,s') only if RowCL(S) ≥ τ(s')`

**Reading.** You may **tighten scope** (use the row for a stronger purpose) only if the row’s CL meets the **higher threshold** for that scope.


#### F.7:12.4 - Contrast decision

**Form.**
`(∃ i<j: CL(SC(Cᵢ)↔SC(Cⱼ)) < τ(Naming‑only)) ⊢ publish‑contrast(S)`

**Reading.** If even **Naming‑only** cannot be licensed, publish a **contrast row** instead of forcing sameness.


#### F.7:12.5 - Row extension guard

**Form.**
`licensable(S,s) ∧ add SC(Cₖ) ⊢ licensable(S∪{SC(Cₖ)}, s) iff ∀ i: CL(SC(Cᵢ)↔SC(Cₖ)) ≥ τ(s)`

**Reading.** You may add a new cell only if it bridges to **every existing cell** at the row’s scope.


#### F.7:12.6 - Loss disclosure obligation

**Form.**
`licensable(S,s) ∧ (∃ i<j: lossNote on Bridge(SC(Cᵢ),SC(Cⱼ))) ⊢ row must carry ≥1 counter‑example`

**Reading.** Any loss note on any supporting Bridge obliges the row to include a **counter‑example one‑liner**.


### F.7:13 - Relations (with other patterns)

**Builds on:**
F.1 **Contexts fixed** → defines the column set; F.2 **Harvest** → supplies term material; F.3 **SenseCells** → provide cell addresses; F.5 **Naming Discipline** → provides the two‑register **FPF labels**; F.9 **Bridges** → legally justify each row.

**Constrains:**
F.4 **Role Description** — when a template cites an FPF label from the table, it **inherits the Row Scope**; no template may claim semantics beyond the row’s licence.
F.6 **Role Assignment & Enactment Cycle (Six-Step)** — Move M‑4 (“choose label”) must reference a row if it wants Cross‑context reading.

**Used by.**
Part C patterns for didactic alignment pages; Part B trust calculus (B.3) may consume **Row CL(min)** when computing translation penalties.


### F.7:14 - Migration notes (conceptual)

1. **Bridge update.** If any supporting Bridge’s CL changes, recompute **Row CL(min)**. If it drops below the printed value, either **lower Row Scope**, **split** the row, or **retire** it.
2. **New Context appears.** Do **not** auto‑expand rows. Test with **12.5**; add only if it brings a **distinct necessity**.
3. **Sense revision inside a Context.** If a SenseCell splits (F.3), decide which child cell (if any) remains in the row; the rest may require **new rows** or a **contrast**.
4. **Scope promotion.** To use a row for a stronger purpose (e.g., from **Naming-only** to **assignment/enactment-eligibility**), first ensure **Row CL(min) ≥ τ(new scope)**; otherwise construct **new Bridges** or **decline** promotion.
5. **Deprecation.** If a row no longer meets its invariant, mark its FPF label as **retired** in F.5 and point to successor rows (if any).
6. **Edition churn.** When a Context is superseded (F.1), either keep the cell (if semantics stable) or treat the successor as a **new Context** and re‑evaluate licensability.


### F.7:15 - Acceptance tests (SCR/RSCR — concept‑level)

#### F.7:15.1 - Static conformance checks (SCR)

* **SCR‑F7‑S01 (Context‑loyal cells).** Every non‑empty cell references an existing **SenseCell** (F.3) in a declared Context (F.1).
* **SCR‑F7‑S02 (Closure & bottleneck).** For each Concept‑Set row, **every pair** of cells has a Bridge path with CL ≥ **Row CL(min)** printed; **Row CL(min)** equals the **minimum** pairwise CL.
* **SCR‑F7‑S03 (Typed & scoped).** Each row declares a **Row Scope** from the controlled set and is **senseFamily‑uniform** (Role **or** Status **or** Measurement **or** Type‑structure…).
* **SCR‑F7‑S04 (Temporal compatibility).** Non‑contrast rows have **compatible** DesignRunTag across cells.
* **SCR‑F7‑S05 (Loss disclosure).** If any supporting Bridge has a recorded loss, the row includes **≥1 counter‑example** line.
* **SCR‑F7‑S06 (Parsimony).** Rows contain **2–4 Contexts** unless a one‑line necessity is stated for each extra Context.

#### F.7:15.2 - Regression checks (RSCR)

* **RSCR‑F7‑E01 (Bridge drift).** After any Bridge change (F.9), recompute **Row CL(min)**; flag rows whose scope is now overstated.
* **RSCR‑F7‑E02 (Sense split).** After a SenseCell splits (F.3), ensure rows referencing it either pick a child cell or retire.
* **RSCR‑F7‑E03 (Scope integrity).** No consumer pattern uses a row outside its declared **Row Scope**.
* **RSCR‑F7‑E04 (No stealth growth).** Additions of cells never lower **Row CL(min)** silently; if they do, either split the row or reduce scope.


### F.7:16 - Didactic distillation (60‑second teaching script)

> “A **Concept-Set row** shows **one idea across Contexts**—but only where explicit **Bridges** license it. Columns are Contexts; cells are **their own labels**. The row prints a **scope** (‘Naming-only’, ‘assignment/enactment-eligibility’, ‘Type-structure’, ‘KD-metric’) and the **weakest CL** that justifies reading across. A **one‑line rationale** says why sameness is safe **here**; a **counter‑example** warns where it breaks. Keep rows small (2–4 Contexts), typed (don’t mix senseFamilies), and temporally honest (design vs run stance). If Bridges don’t suffice, publish a **contrast row** instead. The table doesn’t invent meaning; it **summarises licensed sameness** so readers can cross disciplines without smuggling assumptions.”
