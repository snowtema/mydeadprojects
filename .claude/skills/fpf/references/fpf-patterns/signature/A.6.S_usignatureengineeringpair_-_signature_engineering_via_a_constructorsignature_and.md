## A.6.S - U.SignatureEngineeringPair - Signature engineering via a ConstructorSignature and a TargetSignature

> **Type:** Architectural (A)
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Mixed (normative where RFC 2119 keywords appear; quadrant routing is governed by A.6.B)
> **One-liner:** **explicitly modelling signature engineering as a two‑signature arrangement** (TargetSignature + ConstructorSignature), with strict separation between **operator description** and **enactment as Work by transformer Systems**.

### A.6.S:0 - PCP-TERM/LEX token guards (local-first)

This pattern reserves the following tokens on Tech (normative) surfaces:

* **TargetSignature** — the engineered signature episteme (and its editions) under construction/stabilisation (**not** the described entity, and **not** a Bridge “target Context”).
* **ConstructorSignature** — the enabling signature that describes constructor operations for TargetSignature evolution (do **not** mint a second Tech token such as `EnablingSignature`).

Rename-guards (common collisions):

* **enabling** — Plain adjective meaning “producing/maintaining the TargetSignature”; it is not a `U.*` token.
* **constructor** — MUST be disambiguated as one of: `ConstructorSignature` (episteme), `constructor op` (EFEM), or `constructor System`/`enactor` (transformer). If the physics term is intended, spell **“Constructor Theory”** explicitly.
* **target** — avoid bare “target” in Tech clauses; use `TargetSignature` or qualify the target (e.g., “Bridge target Context”, “target holon”).
* **contract** — Plain shorthand for “published boundary interface description”; it MUST NOT be read as a promise/obligation. Promises, duties, and gates route via A.6.B.

### A.6.S:1 - Problem frame

Boundary descriptions rarely arrive as fully formed signatures. They show up as “half‑signatures”: an n‑ary relation in natural language, a few overloaded markers (“binding”, “anchoring”, “contract”), and implicit assumptions about bases, scope, and viewpoints. Teams then evolve the boundary through incremental edits, reviews, and partial publications.

FPF already provides local disciplines that help unpack such text into well‑formed components: slot discipline (A.6.5) and explicit base declarations (A.6.6). What is usually missing is a *first‑class* description of the engineering interface that turns half‑signatures into stable, publishable boundary interface descriptions (“contracts” in Plain shorthand; see §0 guards)—an explicit ConstructorSignature for constructing and evolving a TargetSignature.

When signature construction is not explicitly modeled, three failures recur:

1. the target boundary contract and the engineering workflow get conflated;
2. semantic changes happen without being made explicit as retargeting or edition changes;
3. published faces (views) drift into adding semantics, making “the contract” ambiguous.

Additionally, authors often (implicitly) treat a signature as if it *acts* (“the constructor builds the signature”).
In FPF this is a category error: an Episteme describes; any change is enacted by a System in a transformer role.
A.6.S therefore must keep **operator descriptions** separate from their **enactment as work**.

### A.6.S:2 - Problem

FPF needs a pattern for **engineering signatures as boundary artifacts**: a disciplined way to construct, revise, and publish a target `U.Signature` from partial input, while maintaining:

* separation between *signature* and *mechanism* (A.6.0 vs A.6.1),
* separation between *laws*, *admissibility*, *deontics*, and *work evidence* (A.6.B),
* explicit multi‑view publication without semantic drift (E.17),
* reproducible evolution across editions without silent mutation.

### A.6.S:3 - Forces

* **Stability vs evolution.** Boundary contracts must be stable enough to coordinate, yet change as understanding improves.
* **Explicitness vs overhead.** Unpacking slots/bases/views increases clarity but also increases authoring effort.
* **Effect‑free operators vs enacted work.** The construction/change language should be expressible as effect‑free epistemic morphisms (no measurement/actuation),
  yet the act of applying them to artifacts is still Work done by transformer Systems and must be auditable.
* **Multi‑view richness vs semantic coherence.** Views help stakeholders, but they risk becoming divergent “versions of truth”.
* **Local meaning vs cross‑context reuse.** Signatures should keep meaning local to a context; reuse across contexts requires explicit bridges and declared loss/penalty policy.
* **Contract talk vs ontology.** “Contract” language invites mixing promises, norms, and invariants; FPF requires quadrant discipline.
* **No epistemic agency.** It is tempting to phrase “the ConstructorSignature constructs…”. In FPF, only Systems act; epistemes do not.

### A.6.S:4 - Solution — two signatures and a small constructor vocabulary

#### A.6.S:4.0 - Ontology and effect profile — constructor operators are epistemes; enactment is Work by transformer Systems

This pattern relies on **Strict Distinction** (A.7) and the **transformer quartet** (A.3):

* **ConstructorSignature (operator description; intensional, D/S-plane).**
  The ConstructorSignature is an **Episteme** (typically a Description/Spec) that *describes* a small family of constructor operations for signature evolution.
  The ConstructorSignature SHALL specify each constructor operation family as an instance/species of `U.EffectFreeEpistemicMorphing` (EFEM; A.6.2) or a declared sub‑species (e.g., A.6.3/A.6.4): **episteme→episteme** morphisms over the `C.2.1 U.EpistemeSlotGraph` positions (`ClaimGraphSlot`, `DescribedEntitySlot`, `GroundingHolonSlot`, `ViewpointSlot`, `ViewSlot`, `ReferenceSchemeSlot`) plus attached meta/edition fields.
  As EFEM, constructor ops are **effect‑free** in the strict A.6.2 sense: **no Work, no Mechanism application, and no mutation of systems or carriers**.
  Concretely: an EFEM step *derives* a successor episteme (often a new edition) and its structured delta; the physical act of materialising that successor on carriers (files, repos, registries, releases, SCR/RSCR pins) is **Work** enacted by a transformer System.

  Slot discipline alignment requirement (A.6.5 / C.2.1:7.1): a conforming ConstructorSignature SHALL state (for each constructor operator family) which `C.2.1` slots it may read and which it may write, expressed in SlotKind/ValueKind/RefKind terms, and SHALL declare whether the operator family is a species of A.6.2 / A.6.3 / A.6.4.

* **Enactor (capability) vs enactment (world-contact).**
  A **System** in a transformer role bears a **Method** that realises the constructor operations (A.3), and it enacts particular steps as **Work / WorkEnactment** on carriers (repos, releases, pins, SCR/RSCR references).
  This is where traces, review records, evidence bindings, and publication artifacts appear.

Therefore:

* A ConstructorSignature **describes** how a TargetSignature may be constructed/evolved; it MUST NOT be written as if it *performs* the construction.
* Any step that performs measurements, actuation, validation runs, or other side‑effects is **not** an EFEM; model it as Work/Mechanism and route resulting claims via A.6.B.

#### A.6.S:4.1 - Core move: model signature engineering as a separate boundary

In a conforming design, model **two signatures**:

1. **TargetSignature.**
   The *target* boundary contract you want to stabilize. It is a `U.Signature` per A.6.0: `SubjectBlock`, `Vocabulary`, `Laws`, `Applicability`. It does **not** contain admissibility gates, deontic obligations, or evidence claims (those are routed per A.6.B).

2. **ConstructorSignature.**
   A *separate* `U.Signature` whose purpose is to describe the **engineering operations** used to construct and evolve the SoI. Intuitively: it is the “interface” of the enabling activity that produces the target interface.

A.6.S names this pairing discipline **U.SignatureEngineeringPair**: a signature engineering arrangement where a ConstructorSignature is explicitly defined for (at least) one Signature‑of‑Interest.
A.6.S names this pairing discipline **U.SignatureEngineeringPair**: a signature engineering arrangement where a ConstructorSignature is explicitly defined for (at least) one TargetSignature.

Minimal definition (informative): a `U.SignatureEngineeringPair` binds exactly two signature artifacts in the same Context: a **TargetSignature** (the contract under stabilization) and a **ConstructorSignature** (the enabling signature describing the constructor operations used to build/evolve the TargetSignature).

**Terminology note (C.2.1 alignment + twin discipline).**
This pattern uses `TargetSignature` as the **Tech role label** for “the signature artifact under construction / stabilisation”.
If a Context wants an explanatory alias, it MAY use **“signature of interest (SoI)”** as a **Plain twin** for `TargetSignature`, but Plain twins are didactic only and MUST NOT appear in conformance/acceptance clauses.

Do not conflate:
* the **TargetSignature** (an episteme artifact that is engineered and published), with
* the TargetSignature’s **`DescribedEntitySlot`** (C.2.1), which refers to the boundary/entity the signature is *about* (a.k.a. “object‑of‑talk / entity‑of‑interest / describedEntity” in C.2.1 commentary).

In C.2.1 terms:
* the TargetSignature is the **episteme** (and its editions) that we engineer and publish;
* the TargetSignature’s `DescribedEntitySlot` refers to the **entity‑of‑interest / object‑of‑talk** (the boundary in the world or model);
* the TargetSignature’s `GroundingHolonSlot` anchors where/how that boundary description is grounded.

If the “SoI” phrasing risks confusion with C.2.1 “entity‑of‑interest” talk, keep it out of Tech/normative prose and use **TargetSignature** vs **ConstructorSignature** consistently.

**Mint-or-Reuse note (informative).**
This pattern introduces the following **Tech role labels** in the A.6 cluster:
* **TargetSignature** — the target boundary contract episteme being stabilised;
* **ConstructorSignature** — the enabling signature (episteme) describing constructor operations for TargetSignature evolution;
* **U.SignatureEngineeringPair** — the two‑signature arrangement (TargetSignature + ConstructorSignature).

If any Plain twins are used (e.g., “signature of interest”), they MUST follow the E.10/F.* twin discipline (1:1 mapping per Context, registry entry, and no use on normative surfaces).

The intended shape is:

* TargetSignature is the boundary contract used by downstream design and realization work.
* ConstructorSignature is the boundary contract used by authors/reviewers to produce and revise the SoI in a disciplined, reproducible way.

This directly operationalises the idea already hinted in the A.6 cluster relations: A.6.5 and A.6.6 can be read as constructor/enabling operations for building well‑formed signatures. The new step is to **bundle those operations into an explicit ConstructorSignature** rather than leaving them as implicit editorial practice.

#### A.6.S:4.2 - Minimal constructor operation vocabulary

A conforming ConstructorSignature **SHALL** (conceptually) expose a *small, composable* set of operations. At minimum, include two groups of constructor operations, drawn from existing A.6 subpatterns:

**(A) Slot‑level constructor operations** (from A.6.5)

Use the canonical slot verbs to express “what changed” without ambiguity:

* `bind` / `rebind` (Identifier → SlotKind/slot‑instance; name binding only)
* `fill`
* `initialize` (first fill)
* `assign` / `set` / `write` / `update` (subsequent fill; by‑value replacement)
* `retarget` (Ref slot update; same SlotKind/ValueKind)
* `substitute` (typed replacement with explicit compatibility claim)
* `resolve` / `dereference` (Ref → referent)
* `pass` (parameter filling at call boundaries)

**Avoid “mutate” as a generic edit verb.**
In Core, `mutate/modify` denotes **referent‑internal change while the slot‑content (Ref handle) stays the same**.
In edition‑disciplined contexts, prefer “revise / re‑edition + retarget” rather than “mutate”.

Guidance for naming (by slot qualifier) is inherited from A.6.5: e.g., `Edit<SlotQualifier>` for by‑value changes, `Retarget<SlotQualifier>` for ref changes, and avoid collapsing retargeting into generic “editing”.

**(B) Base‑level constructor operations** (from A.6.6)

Make base declarations and their evolution explicit via base‑change verbs such as:

* `declareBase`
* `withdrawBaseDecl`
* `rebase`
* `repointDependent`
* `rescope`
* `retime`
* `refreshWitnesses`
* `changeBaseRelation`

A ConstructorSignature does not need *all* of these in every use, but it must provide enough to express “what changed” when the SoI’s grounding base, scope, or anchoring assumptions shift.

**Witness refresh note.**
`refreshWitnesses` is an **edit of witness bindings**, not the generation of new evidence: producing/collecting new witness carriers is **Work**; `refreshWitnesses` only updates the base declaration to reference them.

**Optional but common: view construction operations (A.6.3)**

If the TargetSignature is published via MVPK (recommended), include constructor operations that produce views as **EpistemicViewing** (A.6.3) of the TargetSignature:

* “Emit MVPK faces” as views (PlainView, TechCard, InteropCard, AssuranceLane), explicitly treated as views and governed by E.17 “no new semantics”.
  In particular:
  * `PlainView` / `TechCard` / `InteropCard` MUST add no new claims beyond the underlying TargetSignature/Mechanism claim set.
  * `AssuranceLane` MAY include procedural adjudication guidance and carrier pointers, but any normative pass/fail criteria MUST live canonically in `E-*` claims and be cited by ID.

These are best modeled as view‑producing operations whose output is an MVPK face, with the explicit constraint that the face is a view and therefore does not introduce new claims about the described entity.
Publishing those faces (commits, releases, registry writes) is Work on carriers; it is not “the signature doing things”.

#### A.6.S:4.3 - Change discipline: Viewing vs Retargeting vs editing

To connect signature engineering to A.6.2–A.6.6, treat changes in four buckets:

1. **Viewing (A.6.3).**
   Use when you change *presentation* (views, stakeholder cards, projections) while preserving the described entity.

2. **Slot/base construction edits (A.6.5 / A.6.6).**
   Use when you unpack and make explicit what was implicit (slot kinds, ref modes, base declarations), or when you adjust the SoI’s internal structure without changing what it is “about”.

3. **Editioning + reference retargeting (A.6.5).**
   Use when the contract meaningfully changes and you need a **new SoI edition** for downstream coordination. In that case, do not silently mutate the existing edition: mint a successor edition and **retarget references** (`Retarget<…>` in the relevant Ref slots) to the new edition.

4. **Epistemic retargeting / Structural reinterpretation (A.6.4; rarer).**
   Use only when `DescribedEntityRef` itself changes under an explicit `KindBridge` and stated invariants (e.g., reinterpretation across kinds/planes). This is distinct from ordinary “new version of the same contract”.

Rule of thumb:

* If the change can be defended as “same contract, clearer surface”, prefer slot/base construction plus viewing.
* If the change is “new contract version for consumers”, require a new edition plus explicit reference retargeting.
* If the change is “different described entity / different kind”, use A.6.4 retargeting under `KindBridge` with explicit invariants.

**EFEM discipline.**
Every constructor operation family declared as an EFEM MUST declare `describedEntityChangeMode ∈ {preserve, retarget}` (A.6.2).
**Editioning is orthogonal**: you MAY mint a new edition even under `preserve`, but if you do, downstream references MUST be updated explicitly via slot discipline (A.6.5).
Any operation that performs measurements/actuation/side‑effects MUST be modeled as Work/Mechanism, not as a constructor op.

#### A.6.S:4.4 - Publication and claim discipline for reproducibility

A conforming signature engineering arrangement **SHOULD** include two publication‑adjacent constraints:

1. **MVPK publication for the TargetSignature (E.17).**
   Publish the TargetSignature through MVPK faces as `U.View` projections with viewpoint accountability (`viewRef` + `viewpointRef`). Each face must be explicitly treated as a view and must not introduce new semantic commitments beyond the underlying signature/mechanism claim set (per E.17 “no new semantics”).

2. **Claim Register for boundary discipline (A.6.B).**
   Maintain a claim register that assigns stable identifiers to atomic claims and routes them into the correct quadrant (L/A/D/E). The engineering benefit is that changes to the SoI can be tracked as changes to specific claims rather than as unstructured prose diffs.

This keeps signature engineering aligned with A.6.B’s separation:

* **Laws** live in the SoI (L‑claims).
* **Admissibility** and operational gate conditions live in mechanisms (A‑claims).
* **Deontics** are about agents (D‑claims), not about epistemes.
* **Evidence/work effects** are recorded as outcomes of work (E‑claims), not smuggled into signatures.

#### A.6.S:4.5 - Construction flow as a transduction graph fragment (informative)

If a team already models workflows as E.TGA transduction graphs, the “constructor graph” of A.6.S is a special case:

* EFEM constructor steps can be represented as `U.Transduction(kind=Signature)` vertices (A.6.0), because they are intensional episteme→episteme morphisms (A.6.2).
* Concrete carrier writes (commits, releases, registry writes, SCR/RSCR pinning) are `U.Transduction(kind=Work)` / `U.WorkEnactment` vertices (world‑contact).
* Validations/admission checks live at `U.Transduction(kind=Check)` nodes realised as `OperationalGate(profile)` with a `DecisionLog`.
* Any `DescribedEntityRef`/kind change is a `StructuralReinterpretation` vertex (E.TGA’s use of A.6.4), with explicit `KindBridge` + invariants/witnesses.

This mapping is optional; A.6.S stays usable as a lightweight discipline even without adopting E.TGA structure.

#### A.6.S:4.6 - State during construction (informative)

Do not mint a new kernel “signature state” unless you need it.
In most cases, use:

* **edition** + explicit continuity/withdrawal links for semantic evolution, and
* a coarse **status** (`Draft`/`Review`/`Stable`/`Deprecated`) for process signalling.

If a Context needs a finer lifecycle (e.g., “proposed → reviewed → published → frozen”), model it as Work policy in the ConstructorSignature’s Applicability or as a Context‑local workflow episteme; keep the TargetSignature semantics unchanged.
Where lifecycle is normative, prefer expressing it as a **role-state graph** (A.2.1) borne by the relevant episteme role, rather than minting a new core “signature state”.

### A.6.S:5 - Archetypal Grounding — Tell–Show–Show

**Tell.** A boundary contract becomes stable and evolvable when you model both the *target signature* and the *engineering signature* that constructs it, and you force every change to be expressed as either (a) a view, (b) a disciplined slot/base construction step, or (c) an explicit retargeting to a new edition.

#### A.6.S:5.1 - Show — System archetype

**Context.** A payments microservice exposes an external boundary used by multiple client systems.

**Half‑signature input (what arrives).**
“Service binds a `User` to a `PaymentMethod`, anchors charges to the `Ledger`, and guarantees idempotency.”

**Constructed artifacts.**

* **TargetSignature:** `PaymentBoundarySignature`

  * **Vocabulary:** operations like `Authorize`, `Charge`, `Refund`; slots made explicit (e.g., `UserRefSlot`, `PaymentMethodRefSlot`, `LedgerEntryRefSlot`).
  * **Laws (examples):** “Charge is idempotent under IdempotencyKey”; “Refund does not increase net balance”.
  * **Applicability:** bounded context = “Payments”, scope = “External API”.

* **ConstructorSignature:** `PaymentSignatureEngineering`

  * Transformer system (enactor): `PaymentSignatureEngineeringPipeline` (team + repo + linters + review protocol).
    It enacts the constructor operations as Work and produces new editions and publication carriers.

  * Slot operations used (as operator descriptions; enacted via Work):

    * `bind/rebind` to bind API field names (e.g., `userId`, `paymentMethodId`) to SlotKinds (`UserRefSlot`, `PaymentMethodRefSlot`) where a language surface exists,
    * `initialize` / `edit<…>` to introduce SlotSpecs and to by‑value edit Vocabulary/Laws in the TargetSignature,
    * `resolve<…>` to disambiguate overloaded prose markers (e.g., “idempotency”) into explicit SlotKinds + laws,
    * `retarget<LedgerRefSlot>` when switching the referenced ledger holon/edition (ref change, not by‑value editing).
  * Base operations used:

    * `declareBase` to ground “Ledger” via an explicit baseRelation and scope,
    * `rescope` when moving from “internal ledger view” to “external client view”,
    * `refreshWitnesses` when decision‑relevant evidence/pins must be updated for continued use.

* **Publication.**
  MVPK faces published as views of the TargetSignature: a PlainView for non‑specialists, a TechCard for implementers, and an InteropCard for integrators, all derived without adding new claims beyond the canonical claim set.

**What A.6.S prevents here.** The phrase “guarantees idempotency” does not silently become a deontic promise or an operational gate. It becomes: (a) an L‑claim (law) in the SoI; (b) if needed, a mechanism‑level admissibility condition for when the guarantee holds; and (c) evidence claims in work logs when validated.

#### A.6.S:5.2 - Show — Episteme archetype

**Context.** A research group publishes a “signature” for a boundary concept used across multiple theories (a common “interface” between models).

**Half‑signature input.**
“We define correspondence between model A and model B; parameters are anchored to a reference dataset.”

**Constructed artifacts.**

* **TargetSignature:** `ModelCorrespondenceSignature`

  * **Vocabulary:** relation `Corresponds(A_model, B_model, Φ_bridge)` with explicit slot kinds and ref/value modes.
  * **Laws:** invariants about correspondence preservation (“observable X is preserved up to tolerance ε”).
  * **Applicability:** bounded context = “Model alignment”.

* **ConstructorSignature:** `CorrespondenceSignatureEngineering`

  * Transformer system (enactor): `CorrespondenceSignatureWorkbench` (authors + toolchain) enacts constructor ops as Work.

  * Slot operations used: `resolve` to unpack “correspondence” into an explicit bridge slot; `edit<Laws>` (by‑value) to make tolerance explicit; `retarget<ModelRefSlot>` when moving from a draft model edition to a published edition.
* Base operations used: `declareBase` to ground “reference dataset” as an explicit base with scope/time policy; `retime` when updating the reference window.

* **Publication.**
  The SoI is published in multiple viewpoints (e.g., a mathematical view and an engineering view). Differences are handled as views, not as semantic drift.

**What A.6.S prevents here.** “Anchored to a dataset” does not remain a vague metaphor. It becomes a declared base and, when the dataset changes, an explicit base‑change operation rather than a silent reinterpretation.

### A.6.S:6 - Bias-Annotation

Lenses tested: **Gov**, **Arch**, **Onto/Epist**, **Prag**, **Did**. Scope: **Universal** for signature engineering within the A.6 cluster.

* **Architecture bias (Arch):** pushing a two‑signature structure can feel heavy for small boundaries.
  *Mitigation:* keep the ConstructorSignature minimal; reuse A.6.5/A.6.6 verb sets; treat views as optional unless publication demands them.

* **Onto/Epist bias (Onto/Epist):** treating “editing the signature” as harmless can hide semantic change.
  *Mitigation:* use the Viewing vs Retargeting rule; material meaning changes become explicit retargetings.

* **Pragmatic bias (Prag):** increasing discipline may slow down exploratory work.
  *Mitigation:* allow lightweight ConstructorSignatures early, and tighten conformance as assurance requirements rise.

| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **One artifact tries to be contract + process** | The same doc mixes “what the interface is” with “how we built it”, reviewer notes, and operational gates. | Collapses SoI and ConstructorSignature; quadrant mixing becomes inevitable. | Split into SoI + ConstructorSignature; route gates to mechanisms; route duties to deontics. |
| **Silent semantic edits**                       | A law or applicability quietly changes; consumers discover it through breakage.                           | Treats a new contract as the same contract.                                 | Require retargeting to a new SoI edition for semantic changes.                              |
| **Retargeting disguised as “editing”**          | Ref changes and by‑value edits are described with the same verb.                                          | Loses the slot discipline stratification and review clarity.                | Use A.6.5 canonical verbs and `Edit<SlotQualifier>` vs `Retarget<SlotQualifier>`.           |
| **Views become “alternative truths”**           | PlainView says one thing, TechCard says another, and nobody knows which is canonical.                     | A view gained semantics rather than projecting them.                        | Treat MVPK faces as viewings; put canonical semantics in the SoI and reference it.          |
| **Contract talk without quadrant discipline**   | “The interface promises…” is used to state invariants, obligations, and entry conditions interchangeably. | Blends laws, deontics, admissibility, and evidence.                         | Use A.6.B tags and claim register entries; rewrite claims into the proper quadrant.         |
| **Episteme‑as‑actor**                           | Text says “the ConstructorSignature builds/validates/publishes the SoI”.                                 | Violates “no epistemic agency”; hides the transformer System and the Work.  | Rewrite: constructor ops are described by epistemes; enactment is Work by a transformer System; publish traces/pins explicitly. |

### A.6.S:9 - Consequences

| Benefits                                                                                                                                | Trade-offs / Mitigations                                                                                                                             |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Reproducible signature evolution.** Changes are expressed as explicit constructor operations and, when needed, explicit retargeting.  | **More artifacts.** You now maintain two signatures. *Mitigation:* keep ConstructorSignature minimal; treat it as a thin “change vocabulary” early.  |
| **Boundary discipline becomes teachable.** Reviewers can ask “which constructor op happened here?” instead of arguing over prose diffs. | **Upfront cost.** Slot/base unpacking requires attention. *Mitigation:* reuse A.6.5/A.6.6 templates and canonical verbs.                             |
| **Cleaner separation of concerns.** Signatures stay free of gates and obligations; mechanisms and norms stay explicit.                  | **Temptation to over‑formalize.** Some contexts do not need deep formality. *Mitigation:* apply assurance‑appropriate depth; keep views lightweight. |
| **Multi‑view publication stays coherent.** Views are projections, not semantic forks.                                                   | **Discipline enforcement needed.** Without review habits, teams regress. *Mitigation:* make CC items part of boundary review checklists.             |

**Adoption test (informative).** A Context is “A.6.S‑ready” when, for every TargetSignature change, reviewers can point to (i) the constructor verb(s) used (A.6.5/A.6.6), (ii) the EFEM metadata (`describedEntityChangeMode`, slot read/write profile), and (iii) the Work artefacts that enacted publication (A.3/A.12).

### A.6.S:10 - Rationale

The two‑signature move mirrors a recurring engineering insight: stable interfaces often require an explicit description of the *enabling* interface that produces and maintains them. Without this, “engineering the contract” happens implicitly, and the project loses semantic accountability.

A.6.S treats A.6.5 and A.6.6 as *constructor primitives* and makes them explicit in a ConstructorSignature. This yields a compositional change language: reviewers reason about a boundary’s evolution as sequences of named operations, instead of reverse‑engineering intent from prose.

Connecting signature engineering to A.6.2–A.6.4 provides a principled way to separate:

* **Viewing**: change the view, keep the described entity.
* **Construction edits**: unpack structure without silently changing meaning.
* **Retargeting**: acknowledge a new contract and make the transition explicit.

Finally, routing claims through A.6.B makes “contract” talk ontologically safe: laws, gates, norms, and evidence stop competing for the same paragraph.

**SoTA binding note (informative).** The separation between an operation surface and its effectful realization is adopted from modern algebraic effects/handlers; the view/viewpoint responsibility discipline is adapted from ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010; and the “preservation under change” intuition is adapted from categorical optics (see A.6.S:11).

### A.6.S:11 - SoTA-Echoing

* **Adopt: algebraic effects and effect systems separate operation signatures from handler semantics.**
  Contemporary effect systems emphasise that an operation surface can be described independently of how effects are handled. A.6.S adopts the same separation at the signature‑engineering level: the SoI remains the conceptual boundary surface, while construction work and operational enforcement are handled elsewhere (mechanisms, realizations, work evidence). This echoes row‑typed algebraic effects and modern handler formulations (Leijen 2017; Hillerström & Lindley 2018).

* **Adapt: categorical optics treat “focus” and “round‑trip laws” as a disciplined interface for bidirectional structure.**
  Optics offer a compact mathematical language for “what is preserved” under a transformation and when updates are coherent. A.6.S adapts this mindset to boundary evolution: viewing corresponds to projection, and retargeting corresponds to an explicit transition with stated preservation claims. Profunctor optics provide a post‑2015 reference point for this style of interface reasoning (Pickering, Gibbons & Wu 2017).

* **Adapt: architecture description standards formalise viewpoint/view responsibility and reduce semantic drift across representations.**
  ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010 treats views as products of viewpoints, with explicit stakeholder concerns and responsibility. A.6.S adapts that discipline to signature publication: MVPK faces are explicit views derived from the SoI, and the ConstructorSignature makes “how we got this view” part of the engineering surface (ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2022).

* **Adopt in spirit: behavioural protocol disciplines treat boundaries as safe interaction contracts.**
  Session and behavioural type practice treats boundaries as protocols with progress and safety properties, which matches the A.6 split between signature laws and mechanism entry gates. A.6.S does not import tooling or typechecking, but it adopts the practice of making boundary interactions explicit and law‑governed (e.g., modern MPST practice as cited in A.6.1).

### A.6.S:12 - Relations

* **Depends on:**

  * A.3 — Transformer quartet (MethodDescription / Method / Work / WorkEnactment separation)
  * A.7 — Strict Distinction (object ≠ description ≠ carrier; Face ≠ Surface)
  * A.6 — Signature Stack & Boundary Discipline
  * A.6.0 — `U.Signature`
  * A.6.2 — `U.EffectFreeEpistemicMorphing` (constructor ops are EFEM species)
  * A.12 — Transformer role (enactment is by Systems, not epistemes)
  * C.2.1 — Episteme slots (`DescribedEntitySlot`, `ViewpointSlot`, `ViewSlot`) and naming deconfliction
  * (optional) E.18 — E.TGA, if the constructor flow is represented as a transduction graph fragment
  * E.10 / LEX discipline — if the Context uses Plain twins (“SoI”) or shorthands, they must be registered and kept off normative surfaces
  * A.6.3 — `U.EpistemicViewing`
  * A.6.4 — `U.EpistemicRetargeting`
  * A.6.5 — `U.RelationSlotDiscipline`
  * A.6.6 — `U.AnchorAndBaseDiscipline`
  * A.6.B — Boundary Norm Square & Claim Register discipline
  * E.17 / E.17.0 — MVPK and multi‑view describing

* **Strengthens:** A.6.5 and A.6.6 by making their operation vocabularies first‑class as constructor operations.

* **Constrains:** Any signature evolution narrative: semantic changes must be explicit new editions + reference retargeting; publication faces must be viewings.

#### A.6.S:12.1 - Integration pointers (informative)

Grounding pointers in the current FPF draft (for alignment while integrating):

* Canonical pattern template order and section requirements (E.8).
* SoTA‑Echoing requirements and avoidance of data governance/tool binding (E.8:11, E.8:8).
* A.6 cluster explicitly treats A.6.5/A.6.6 as constructor/enabling operations (motivation for A.6.S).
* A.6.2 “effect‑free episteme morphisms” boundary (constructor ops are EFEM; work/mechanisms are separate).
* A.3 transformer quartet (MethodDescription vs Method vs Work) for “constructor described vs enacted”.
* A.7 strict distinction and Face/Surface separation (no object–description–carrier soup).
* A.12 external transformer / transformer role discipline (enactment is by Systems; no epistemic agency).
* Slot operation lexicon and naming guidance (A.6.5).
* Base‑change operation lexicon (A.6.6).
* MVPK faces as fixed view kinds with “no new semantics” intent (E.17).
* Claim register and quadrant separation discipline (A.6.B).
