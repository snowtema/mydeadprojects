## A.6.0 - U.Signature - Universal, law‑governed declaration for a SubjectKind on a BaseType

**Status.** Architectural pattern, kernel‑level and universal.  
**Placement.** Part A (Kernel), **before A.6.1** (“U.Mechanism”).  
**Builds on.** **A.2.6** (USM: context slices & scopes), **E.8** (authoring order), **E.10** LEX-BUNDLE (registers, naming, stratification), **E.10.D1** D.CTX (Context discipline).
  
**Coordinates with.** **A.6.1** (U.Mechanism), **A.6.5** (`U.RelationSlotDiscipline` for n‑ary arguments), **E.5.3** (Unidirectional Dependency), **E.10** (LEX-BUNDLE), and **Part F** (harnesses & cross-context transport; naming). Conformance keywords: RFC 2119.

### A.6.0:1 - Problem frame

FPF already uses “signatures” to stabilise public promises of **reusable extension vocabularies** and, via **A.6.1**, of **mechanisms**. But authors also need stable, minimal declarations for **theories**, **methods** (operational families), and **disciplines** (regulated vocabularies). Without **one** universal notion of signature:
* similar constructs proliferate under incompatible names;
* readers cannot tell what is **declared** (intension & laws) versus what is **implemented** (specification);
* cross‑context reuse lacks a canonical place to state **applicability** and **lawful vocabularies**.

E.8 demands a single authoring voice and section order; E.10 demands lexical discipline across strata. A.6.0 provides the common kernel shape these patterns presuppose.

### A.6.0:2 - Problem

If each family (theories, mechanisms, methods, disciplines) invents its own “signature”:

1. **Tight coupling.** Private definitions leak as public standards, breaking substitutability.
    
2. **Lexical drift.** The same surface label (e.g., *scope*, *normalization*) hides different laws.
    
3. **Scope opacity.** Applicability (where the words mean what) remains implicit, violating D.CTX.
    

### A.6.0:3 - Forces

| Force | Tension |
| --- | --- |
| **Universality vs. fitness** | One shape must fit **Kernel**, **Mechanisms**, **Protocols**, and other specialised signatures, without over‑committing to any one family. |
| **Intension vs. specification (I/D/S)** | Signatures declare **what** and **the laws** (intension), not recipes or test harnesses (specification). |
| **Simplicity vs. expressivity** | Keep the kernel small while allowing family‑specific header metadata and readable projections (e.g., imports/provides DAGs, assurance matrices, transport views). |
| **Locality vs. transport** | Meaning is context‑local (D.CTX); transport must remain explicit and auditable (Part F) without smuggling implementation. |

### A.6.0:4 - Solution — **Define `U.Signature` once, reuse everywhere**

**Definition.** A **`U.Signature`** is a **public, law-governed declaration** for a named **SubjectKind** on a declared **BaseType**. The Signature **SHALL** expose an explicit **SliceSet** and **ExtentRule**; if quantification is context‑independent, authors **MUST** use a trivial `SliceSet` (e.g., a singleton) and a constant `ExtentRule` rather than omitting these fields. A Signature (i) introduces a **vocabulary** (types, relations, operators), (ii) states **laws** (axioms/invariants; no operational admissions), and (iii) records **applicability** (where and under which contextual assumptions the declarations hold). Dependencies (**imports**) and exported names (**provides**) are declared in a `SignatureManifest` (see §4.4.1) and are **not** part of the four‑row Signature Block. **Discipline for argument-position typing is delegated to A.6.5 `U.RelationSlotDiscipline`: whenever the Vocabulary declares an n-ary relation or operator, SlotSpecs for its parameter positions SHALL be provided as in §4.1.1 and A.6.5.**

Where the **Vocabulary** introduces an **n‑ary relation or morphism**, the Signature **SHALL**, for each parameter position `i`, declare a `SlotSpec_i = ⟨SlotKind_i, ValueKind_i, refMode_i⟩` as defined in **A.6.5 `U.RelationSlotDiscipline`**. SlotSpecs live inside the per‑relation parameter block of the **Vocabulary** row and **MUST NOT** introduce additional rows beyond the four‑row Signature Block.

**Arrow form (typing for MVPK).** Author a Signature as a **morphism**  
`SigDecl : ⟨SubjectBlock⟩ → ⟨Vocabulary × Laws × Applicability⟩`  
where `SubjectBlock = ⟨SubjectKind, BaseType, SliceSet, ExtentRule, ResultKind?⟩`. This makes `U.Signature` directly consumable by **E.17 MVPK** (publication of morphisms) without adding semantics on faces (no new claims; pins for any numeric content).

*Guard clarification (normative).* **Operational guard predicates** (run‑time or admission guards) **BELONG ONLY** to **A.6.1 Mechanisms**. A Signature may express **domain/type constraints** intensionally (e.g., restricting an operator’s domain) but **SHALL NOT** encode operational admissions.

*Guidance for deductive substrates.* Signatures that declare a **formal deductive substrate** (e.g., *FormalSubstrate*) MAY include, **as vocabulary elements**, an **EffectDiscipline** (algebraic/row/graded effect signatures) and **InferenceKind** enumerations; handler semantics are **out of scope** for Signatures (see §4.3). The universal block remains conceptual and contains **no** run‑time admissions or AdmissibilityConditions.

**Naming discipline.** The `Subject` **MUST** be a **single‑sense** noun phrase; avoid synonyms/aliases within the same Signature.

A `U.Signature` is conceptual: it contains no implementation, no packaging/CI metadata, and no Γ-builders. If a family wants to expose a Γ‑like *builder/aggregator*, publish it **outside** the Signature Block (typically as an **A.6.1** Mechanism‑level operator) and **namespace** it under the Signature id; do not treat Γ as part of the canonical Vocabulary.

#### A.6.0:4.1 - The **Signature Block (universal form)**

The **four conceptual rows** (“SubjectBlock / Vocabulary / Laws / Applicability”) give a repeatable, holon‑stable pattern across mathematics → physics → engineering:  
* **SubjectBlock** = *what it’s about + how quantified* (axiomatics + domain of interpretation),  
* **Vocabulary/Laws** = *principles/laws* (postulates & constraints),  
* **Applicability** = *where they hold in practice* (bounded context & time).

Every `U.Signature` **SHALL** present a **four‑row conceptual block** (names are universal; family‑specific aliases are mapped below):

1. **SubjectBlock** — ⟨**SubjectKind**, **BaseType**, **SliceSet**, **ExtentRule**, **ResultKind?**⟩.  
   *SubjectKind* names the intensional subject (C.3); *BaseType* is the `U.Type` the signature ranges over (CHR Spaces appear here **as types**, not as field names); *SliceSet* addresses the quantification domain (USM; e.g., **ContextSliceSet**); *ExtentRule* computes `Extension(SubjectKind, slice)` (C.3.2); *ResultKind?* (optional) is the intensional kind of outputs.  
   **Editorial split (allowed).** Authors **MAY** render the **SubjectBlock** as two adjacent lines — **Subject** *(SubjectKind, BaseType)* and **Quantification** *(SliceSet, ExtentRule, ResultKind?)* — **without changing semantics**. Even when visually split, SubjectBlock counts as **one** conceptual row.

   **Semantic roles of the SubjectBlock kinds (informative)**
   * **SubjectKind (intent).** The intensional “describedEntity” of the signature (C.3.1), ordered by `⊑`. It carries no Scope.
   * **BaseType (carrier).** The `U.Type` over which values/objects are ranged. In CHR regimes this may be a `U.CharacteristicSpace` **type**; elsewhere it is a set‑typed `U.Type`.
   * **SliceSet (addressability).** The addressable set of `U.ContextSlice`s (USM). It identifies where **extent** is computed; it is not a “space” unless CHR.
   * **ExtentRule (extent).** A rule yielding `Extension(SubjectKind, slice)` (C.3.2); this is the quantifier’s domain, computed per slice.
   * **ResultKind? (outputs).** Optional: the intensional kind of the outputs of the operations declared in *Vocabulary* (use when outputs differ in kind from the SubjectKind).
    
2. **Vocabulary** — names and sorts of the public **types / relations / operators** this signature commits to (no handler semantics; no AdmissibilityConditions). For each **n‑ary relation or morphism** in the Vocabulary, parameters **SHALL** be declared via **SlotSpecs** `SlotSpec_i = ⟨SlotKind, ValueKind, refMode⟩` per **A.6.5 `U.RelationSlotDiscipline`**. SlotKinds and RefKinds **MUST** follow the `…Slot` / `…Ref` lexical discipline in **A.6.5** and **E.10 (LEX‑BUNDLE)**; ValueKinds **MUST** remain free of these suffixes.
   (No additional rows beyond the four‑row Signature Block.)
  
3. **Laws (Axioms/Invariants)** — equations and order/closure laws that are context‑local truths under the stated Applicability (no proofs here). **Operational guard predicates belong to Mechanisms (A.6.1)**, not to Signatures.
    
4. **Applicability (Scope & Context)** — conditions under which the laws are valid (bounded context, plane, stance, time notions). Applicability **MUST** bind a **`U.BoundedContext`** (D.CTX). Applicability here is the *context of meaning* for the Signature’s vocabulary/laws; it **MUST NOT** be used to encode claim‑level applicability, which remains a **Scope** on claims (USM / C.3.2). Cross‑context use **MUST NOT** be implicit; if intended, **name** the Bridge (conceptual reference only). When numeric comparability is implied, **bind** legality to **CG‑Spec/MM‑CHR** (normalize‑then‑compare; lawful scales/units).
    
*Mapping to existing families (normative aliases).*  
— **A.6.1 (Mechanism).** *SubjectBlock* ↔ **SubjectKind/BaseType/…**; *Vocabulary* ↔ **OperationAlgebra**; *Laws* ↔ **LawSet**; *Applicability* remains contextual; **AdmissibilityConditions** — separate field of mechanism (not in the `U.Signature`).  
— **Task/Problem/Discipline signatures (C.22, G-cluster).** These **SHALL** be introduced as **species of `U.Signature`** that reuse the same four-row Block (SubjectBlock / Vocabulary / Laws / Applicability); any extra per-family views are projections only (no new conceptual rows).

*Optional projection views (normative).* Publications MAY include additional **projection views** (e.g., a Dependency View listing `imports/provides`, or an Assurance View listing audit/evidence hooks), but such views:
1) MUST be mechanically derivable from `SignatureManifest` + the four‑row Block (and referenced ClaimIds where used), and
2) MUST NOT introduce new semantics, obligations, or “extra rows”.

##### A.6.0:4.1.1 - SlotSpec for argument positions (normative; see A.6.5)

For every **n‑ary relation or operator** declared in the **Vocabulary** row, the Signature **SHALL** assign, to each argument position, a **SlotSpec** triple:

```text
+SlotSpec_i := ⟨SlotKind_i, ValueKind_i, refMode_i⟩
```

where:
* **SlotKind_i** is a named position in the relation/operator (Tech name with `…Slot` suffix) whose semantics are documented (see A.6.5).
* **ValueKind_i** is the FPF type (`U.Kind` or kernel‑level type) of admissible occupants at that position.
* **refMode_i** is either `ByValue` or a **RefKind** (e.g., `U.EntityRef`, `U.HolonRef`), indicating whether the episteme stores values directly or references/identifiers.

Full discipline and lexical rules for **SlotKind/ValueKind/RefKind** are given in A.6.5 `U.RelationSlotDiscipline` and E.10 (§8.1). A.6.0 requires that every vocabulary‑level relation or operator that takes arguments **declare** these SlotSpecs; downstream patterns MAY provide templates for common shapes (e.g., episteme slots in C.2.1).

**Mini‑example (informative).** For an episteme kind `ModelEvaluationResultKind`, a simplified episteme might expose:
* `describedEntityRef : U.MethodRef`
* `datasetRef : U.EntityRef`
* `metricRef : U.CharacteristicRef`
* `groundingHolonRef : U.HolonRef`
* `claimGraph : U.ClaimGraph`

An authorial SlotSpec table then reads:

| Parameter (episteme field)   | SlotKind              | ValueKind          | refMode                |
| ---------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| `describedEntityRef`   | `DescribedEntitySlot` | `U.Method`         | `U.MethodRef`          |
| `datasetRef`           | `DatasetSlot`         | `U.Entity`         | `U.EntityRef`          |
| `metricRef`            | `MetricSlot`          | `U.Characteristic` | `U.CharacteristicRef`  |
| `groundingHolonRef`    | `GroundingHolonSlot`  | `U.Holon`          | `U.HolonRef`           |
| `claimGraph`           | `ClaimGraphSlot`      | `U.ClaimGraph`     | `ByValue`              |

This example illustrates the intended reading: **parameters are typed twice**—once by their **ValueKind** (what sort of thing occupies the position) and once by **refMode** (by‑value or which RefKind). SlotKinds (with `…Slot` suffix) give stable names for substitution laws and describedEntity statements across patterns.

#### A.6.0:4.2 - Profile specialisations (normative; structure‑preserving)
To enable first‑principles layers without minting new Kernel kinds, apply **profiles** to `U.Signature`:

* **`profile = FormalSubstrate`** — *formal‑deductive layer*  
  **Vocabulary:** `TermRegister` (ref‑only), **InferenceKinds** (ref‑only), **EffectDiscipline** (operation/effect signatures).  
  **Laws:** equational/structural axioms of the calculus; **no handler semantics**.  
  **Applicability:** binds a `U.BoundedContext` at the **concept‑plane**; **no units/ReferencePlane/Transport** on faces.  
  **MVPK pins:** **`No‑Realization` pin (mandatory)** on `PlainView`/`TechCard` asserting that handler semantics live only in **A.6.1 `U.Mechanism::U.EffectRealization`**.  
  **Faces:** On MVPK faces, **`InferenceKindsAllowed`** MAY present a **ref‑only subset** of the enumerated **`InferenceKinds`**; Signatures do not add handler semantics.

* **`profile = PrincipleFrame`** — *postulates + measurability intent (CHR‑binding)*  
  **Vocabulary:** **PostulateSet** (in the calculus imported), **CHR‑Binding presence** (ref‑only to characteristics/observation profiles), **Ontology anchors** (ref‑only to substrate types/morphisms used to name subject‑matter entities).  
  **Laws:** timeless/order‑free invariants; **no operational admissions**.  
  **Applicability:** binds a `U.BoundedContext`; **Signatures SHALL NOT publish units/ReferencePlane/ComparatorSet/Transport** (first mention is in **UNM**).
  **MVPK pins:** **`NoReferencePlaneOnSignature`** (alias: **`NoReferencePlaneOnPF`**) and **`UNM‑priority`** (units/planes/comparators/Transport are declared only by **`U.ContextNormalization`** and cited by edition/ref‑id where needed).

**Profile morphism discipline.** See §4.6 for the **structure‑preserving morphism** requirements for profile application.

#### A.6.0:4.3 - Effect‑discipline vs handler semantics (normative split)

If a Signature’s **Vocabulary** includes an **EffectDiscipline** (operation/effect signatures), the Signature **SHALL NOT** declare **handler semantics** or any **EffectRealization**. Such realizations are authored only under **A.6.1 `U.Mechanism`** and cited by **ref‑id** on faces where needed. This mirrors the modern algebraic‑effects separation between *operation signatures* and *handlers* while keeping A.6.0 purely conceptual.

#### A.6.0:4.4 - Authoring rules (I/D/S‑aware; lexically disciplined)

* **I/D/S separation.** A signature **states intension and laws**; Realizations (if any) carry **specifications**. Do not mix tutorial text or operational recipes into the Block. Do **not** include **AdmissibilityConditions** or run‑time admissions here.
* **Context discipline.** Bind Applicability to a **`U.BoundedContext`**. If cross‑context use is intended, **name** the crossing and **reference** the Bridge (Part F/B); A.6.0 does **not** prescribe **compatibility/loss tables (CL, including `CL^plane`)** or penalty formulas.
* **Stratification.** Use LEX‑BUNDLE registers and strata; do not redefine Kernel names in lower strata (no cross‑bleed).  
* **Signature manifest.** If the signature is intended to be imported/reused, publish a `SignatureManifest` immediately above the Block with explicit `id`, `imports`, and `provides` lists (§4.4.1). Keep the universal four‑row Block free of dependency/export metadata.

* **Realization discipline (normative extension point).** If a family publishes any *Realization* of a `U.Signature`, each Realization **MUST** (i) declare which `SignatureId` it implements, (ii) satisfy the Signature’s **Laws** (and imported laws) and **MAY** tighten them but **MUST NOT** relax them, and (iii) treat imported Signatures as **opaque**—it **MUST NOT** depend on their internal structure beyond what is exported via `provides` and cited via ClaimIds. Realization‑specific build/tooling/test metadata belongs to the Realization artifact, not to the `U.Signature` Block.

##### A.6.0:4.4.1 - SignatureManifest (imports/provides; normative)

A `U.Signature` MAY be prefixed with a lightweight manifest that makes boundary dependencies explicit **without** introducing a separate “module system”.

**SignatureManifest** fields (conceptual; concrete syntax is editorial):

- `id : SignatureId` — stable identifier for cross-references.
- `version : SemVer` (optional; **required when the signature is imported/reused**).
- `status : {draft | review | stable | deprecated}` (optional).
- `imports : [SignatureId]` — other signatures whose **provides** are referenced by this signature (directed edges; possibly empty).
- `provides : [SymbolId]` — the **only** new public symbols minted by this signature that downstream text may depend on (**types, relations, operators, SlotKinds, RefKinds**).

**Norms (boundary hygiene):**

- **Acyclicity.** The directed graph induced by `imports` MUST be acyclic.
- **Layering.** `imports` **MUST** respect **E.5.3** (Unidirectional Dependency) and **E.10** strata/token‑class discipline; do not import from a lower stratum or across a forbidden dependency direction.
- **No redeclare.** `provides(S)` MUST NOT re‑declare any symbol already provided by any transitive import of `S`.
- **No ghost dependencies (vocabulary symbols).** Any non‑Kernel **SymbolId** referenced in the **SubjectBlock** or **Vocabulary** rows (including `BaseType`, `ResultKind?`, operator names, SlotKinds, ValueKinds, RefKinds) that is **not** provided by this signature MUST be provided by some imported signature. References that are *not* vocabulary symbols—e.g., **ClaimIds**, **BridgeIds**, **policy‑ids**, or **EditionIds**—are exempt.
- **Law anchoring.** When downstream text depends on laws/constraints from an imported signature, it SHOULD cite the corresponding **ClaimId** (A.6.B), not paraphrase prose.

The A.6.0 four‑row Block remains the source of truth for meaning (Vocabulary/Laws/Applicability). The manifest only declares dependency edges and exported names.

* **Token hygiene.** Do **not** mint new `U.*` tokens inside a Signature without a **DRR**; prefer referencing existing Kernel/Extension `U.Type`s. 

*MVPK publication discipline for Signatures (normative).* When publishing a `U.Signature` via MVPK (E.17), faces **SHALL** be typed projections that add **no new claims**; any numeric/comparable statement **MUST** pin unit/scale/reference‑plane/**EditionId** to **CG‑Spec/MM‑CHR** where applicable. For deductive substrates, faces **MUST** carry a **No‑Realization pin** (handlers/realizers absent). For Principle‑level signatures, faces **MUST NOT** introduce units/ReferencePlane/Transport (first mention occurs in UNM).

#### A.6.0:4.5 - Specialisation knobs (for downstream patterns)

A.6.0 exposes **three** conceptual knobs; downstream patterns (A.6.1, method/discipline specs) may **tighten** them:

1. **Builder policy.** The Block MUST NOT export Γ‑builders. If a family publishes a Γ‑like builder/aggregator, it MUST be outside the Block (typically as an **A.6.1** Mechanism‑level operator), explicitly marked optional, and namespaced under the Signature id.
    
2. **Transport clause.** If cross‑context/plane use is part of the design, the signature **may declare** a conceptual Transport clause; **A.6.1** gives a concrete schema (Bridge, **CL/CL^k/CL^plane**—Bridges per **F.9**, penalties per **B.3**, **CL^plane** per **C.2.1**), but A.6.0 remains agnostic about penalty shapes.
    
3. **Morphisms.** Families may define `SigMorph` (refinement, conservative extension, equivalence, quotient, product) to relate signatures; **A.6.1** instantiates this for mechanisms. Where such morphisms, or downstream **substitution / retargeting** laws (e.g., **A.6.2–A.6.4**), act on **n‑ary relations or morphisms**, they **SHALL** express their read/write/retargeting discipline in terms of **SlotSpecs**  (SlotKind / ValueKind / RefKind) rather than unnamed parameter indices, using **A.6.5 `U.RelationSlotDiscipline`** as the normative slot calculus.

#### A.6.0:4.6 - Profile‑specialisation as a structure‑preserving morphism (normative)
Profile application `ι_profile : U.Signature → U.Signature(profile=…)` **SHALL** be a **structure‑preserving morphism**:
— **SubjectBlock** is preserved up to α‑renaming (SubjectKind/BaseType unchanged; ResultKind? only added when it exists in the universal intent).  
— **Vocabulary** is **monotone** (adds or refines names/sorts without contradicting existing ones).  
— **Laws** are **monotone** (add/strengthen axioms; never weaken).  
— **Applicability** is **restrictive** (binds or tightens `U.BoundedContext`; never widens implicitly).  
— No **AdmissibilityConditions**, **operational guards**, or **handler semantics** are introduced by the profile (those live under **A.6.1**).  
This makes `profile=FormalSubstrate` and `profile=PrincipleFrame` *morphisms* in the sense of kernel specialisation and supports SigMorph reasoning (refinement/conservative extension).
   
### A.6.0:5 - Archetypal Grounding (Tell–Show–Show)

| quartet Element | `U.System` Example — **Grammar of Motions** | `U.Episteme` Example — **Normalization Family** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **SubjectBlock** | **Subject:** SubjectKind=`MotionGrammar`; BaseType=`U.System:TrajectorySpace`. **Quantification:** SliceSet=`U.ContextSliceSet`; ExtentRule=`admissible motion words per slice (kinematics & domain restrictions)`; ResultKind?=`Language[Segment]`. | **Subject:** SubjectKind=`NormalizationMethod‑Class`; BaseType=`U.Episteme:ChartFamily` (one `U.BoundedContext`). **Quantification:** SliceSet=`U.ContextSliceSet`; ExtentRule=`admissible method instances per slice (edition+validity)`; ResultKind?=`NormalizedChart`. |
| **Vocabulary** | Types: `Pose`, `Segment`; Operators: `concat`, `reverse`, `sample` (any Γ‑like aggregator is published outside the Signature Block, typically as a Mechanism‑level operator namespaced under the Signature id). | Operators: `apply(method)`, `compose`, `quotient(≡)`. |
| **Laws (Invariants/Constraints)** | Closure of `concat`; associativity; time‑monotone sampling; **`reverse` is declared only for holonomic arms (domain restriction)**. | Ratio→positive‑scalar; Interval→affine; Ordinal→monotone; Nominal→categorical; LUT(+uncertainty). |
| **Applicability (Scope & Context)** | Context: *industrial robotics*; stance: design; time notion: discrete ticks. Cross‑context transport not declared. | Context: *clinical metrics*; stance: analysis; validity windows declared; cross‑context transport via Bridge (concept only; details per A.6.1). Numeric comparability bound to CHR/CG‑Spec. |

*Why these two?* E.8 requires pairs from **U.System** and **U.Episteme** to demonstrate trans‑disciplinary universality.

### A.6.0:6 - Bias‑Annotation (lenses & defaults)

* **Local‑first meaning.** Laws are **local** to the named Context; cross‑context use must be explicit (Bridge), never implicit.
    
* **No illicit scalarisation.** If numbers appear, legal comparability follows **CG‑Spec/MM‑CHR**; **no ordinal means**, **partial orders return sets**; unit/scale alignment is explicit.
    
* **Register hygiene.** Keep Tech vs Plain register pairs; avoid tooling/vendor talk in Kernel prose (E.10).
  
### A.6.0:7 - Conformance Checklist (normative)

| ID | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| **CC‑A.6.0‑1** | A conformant text labelled **`U.Signature`** **SHALL** expose the **four‑row Signature Block**: *SubjectBlock; Vocabulary; Laws; Applicability*. A visual split of SubjectBlock into **Subject**/**Quantification** lines is allowed; it still counts as **one** conceptual row. |
| **CC‑A.6.0‑2** |  The Signature Block MUST remain conceptual: no code/CI metadata, no tool bindings, no execution steps, no implementation details, and no Γ‑builder exports. Dependency/export metadata belongs in the `SignatureManifest` (§4.4.1), not inside the four‑row Block. |
| **CC‑A.6.0‑3** | Applicability **binds** a `U.BoundedContext`; if cross‑context use is intended, a **Transport clause** is *named* (Bridge reference) without re‑stating Part F/B.3 details (including any **CL^plane**). |
| **CC‑A.6.0‑4** | Where numeric comparability is implied, Applicability **binds** to **CG‑Spec/MM‑CHR** legality (normalize‑then‑compare; scale/unit alignment). |
| **CC‑A.6.0‑5** | Families that specialise A.6.0 (e.g., A.6.1, method/discipline profiles) MAY add extra constraints and projection views, but MUST preserve the four‑row Block as the canonical core (no extra semantic rows). |
| **CC‑A.6.0‑6** | Under E.10/E.5, tokens MUST respect strata/family segregation: never redefine Kernel tokens in an Extension/Context/Instance signature; instead, import and align. |
| **CC‑A.6.0‑7** | The **Laws** row contains **axioms/invariants** only; **AdmissibilityConditions** and operational admissions **MUST** appear only in **A.6.1 Mechanisms** that consume this Signature. |
| **CC‑A.6.0‑8 (No‑Realization on Signatures with EffectDiscipline).** | If **EffectDiscipline** appears in **Vocabulary**, faces **MUST** carry a **`No‑Realization` pin** and **MUST NOT** publish handler semantics; any **EffectRealization** is referenced (A.6.1) by id only. |
| **CC‑A.6.0‑9 (CHR‑binding without units/Transport).** | Signatures that declare **measurability intent** (e.g., PrincipleFrame) **SHALL NOT** publish **units, ReferencePlane, ComparatorSet, or Transport**; those are declared only by **UNM** and cited by edition/ref‑id where consumers require numeric comparability. |
| **CC‑A.6.0‑10 (UNM‑priority on faces).** | Any numeric/comparable claim on a Signature face **pins** **CG‑Spec/ComparatorSet edition ids** and, where scale/plane conversion occurs, **UNM.TransportRegistry edition** with **CL/CL^plane policy‑ids**; **penalties route to R/R_eff only**. |
| **CC‑A.6.0‑11 (Bridge‑only crossings).** | Cross‑context/plane reuse of Signature claims **MUST** name a **Bridge** (UTS row) and **MUST NOT** imply implicit equivalence by label; losses are recorded via **CL** (penalties → **R**). |
| **CC‑A.6.0‑12 (Profile conformance).** | If the Signature declares `profile=FormalSubstrate` or `profile=PrincipleFrame`, the corresponding **profile pins** in §4.2 are **mandatory**; failure to emit them makes the Signature **non‑conformant** for that profile. |
| **CC‑A.6.0‑13 (Profile morphism discipline).** | Applying a profile **SHALL** satisfy §4.6 (structure‑preserving morphism: SubjectBlock preserved, Vocabulary/Laws monotone, Applicability restrictive, no admissibility/handlers). |
| **CC‑A.6.0‑14 (SlotSpec for argument positions).** | Any `U.Signature` whose **Vocabulary** declares n‑ary relations or operators **SHALL** provide, for each argument position, a **SlotSpec** triple `⟨SlotKind, ValueKind, refMode⟩` (with `refMode ∈ {ByValue \| RefKind}`) as per A.6.5 `U.RelationSlotDiscipline`. |
| **CC‑A.6.0‑15 (Slot/Ref lexical discipline on signatures).** | Names of SlotKinds and RefKinds used in SlotSpecs **MUST** obey E.10/A.6.5 lexical guards: tokens ending with **`…Slot`** denote SlotKinds only; tokens ending with **`…Ref`** denote either RefKinds or episteme fields whose type is a RefKind; no ValueKind ends with these suffixes. |
| **CC‑A.6.0‑16 (SlotSpecs for n‑ary relations).** | Any `U.Signature` whose **Vocabulary** declares an **n‑ary relation or morphism** **SHALL** assign to each parameter position a `SlotSpec_i = ⟨SlotKind, ValueKind, refMode⟩` as defined in **A.6.5 `U.RelationSlotDiscipline`**; SlotSpecs live inside the Vocabulary row’s per‑relation parameter block and **MUST NOT** introduce additional rows beyond the four‑row Block. |
| **CC‑A.6.0‑17 (SlotSpec‑based substitution laws).** | Specialisations of A.6.0 that define **substitution, retargeting, or profile application** over n‑ary relations/morphisms (e.g., **A.6.2–A.6.4**) **SHALL** phrase their rules in terms of **SlotSpecs** (SlotKind / ValueKind / RefKind) rather than unnamed parameter indices and **SHALL** obey the `…Slot` / `…Ref` lexical discipline in **A.6.5** and **F.18**. |
| **CC‑A.6.0‑18 (Manifest required for reuse).** | If a signature is intended to be imported/reused, it MUST include a `SignatureManifest` (§4.4.1) with explicit `id`, `version`, `imports`, and `provides`. |
| **CC‑A.6.0‑19 (Imports acyclicity).** | If `imports` is present, it MUST be acyclic (no cycles in the signature import graph). |
| **CC‑A.6.0‑20 (No redeclare across imports).** | If `imports` is present, `provides(S)` MUST NOT re‑declare any symbol already provided by any transitive import of `S`. |
| **CC‑A.6.0‑21 (No ghost dependencies).** | If `imports` is present, any non‑Kernel **SymbolId** referenced in the **SubjectBlock/Vocabulary** rows that is **not** provided by this signature MUST be provided by some imported signature (ClaimIds/BridgeIds/policy‑ids/EditionIds are exempt). |
| **CC‑A.6.0‑22 (Realization opacity).** | If a family publishes any Realization of a `U.Signature`, that Realization **MUST** treat imported Signatures as **opaque** (depend only on their `provides` symbols and cited ClaimIds), and **MUST NOT** reference internal structure of imported Signatures. |
| **CC‑A.6.0‑23 (Monotone Realization).** | A Realization **MAY** tighten but **MUST NOT** relax the Signature’s Laws; if weaker laws are needed, authors MUST mint a new Signature (or publish an explicit refinement morphism) rather than weakening an existing contract. |

### A.6.0:8 - Consequences

* **Uniform kernel shape.** Authors can define **theory**, **mechanism**, **method**, **discipline**, or other family signatures without inventing new templates.
    
* **Hard decoupling.** Boundary surfaces stay stable: the A.6.0 Block defines the contract, while mechanisms/realizations can evolve behind it (with monotone strengthening and explicit guard surfaces).
    
**Didactic cohesion.** Readers see the same four conceptual rows across the spec, satisfying E.8’s comparability goal.

### A.6.0:9 - Rationale

**Why “SubjectBlock”?** A.6.1 showed that making the **carrier explicit** (here: *BaseType* — the carrier type) avoids category mistakes when moving between domains (e.g., *set‑algebra on context slices* vs *equivalence‑classes of normalisations*). A.6.0 lifts this to the kernel so every signature can declare **what it is about** before saying **what it provides**.
**Why one universal Block?** Experience with extension/mechanism signatures shows the value of a single canonical “shape” for Vocabulary/Laws/Applicability/Alignment; A.6.0 factors that universal core so other families can add headers and views without fragmenting the Kernel.

**Informative echoes (post‑2015 SoTA).**  
— **Algebraic effects & handlers** (OCaml 5, Koka, Effekt, Links): *operation signatures + handler laws* mirror **Vocabulary + Laws** while keeping implementations separate.  
— **Session/behavioural types** (2016–2024): protocol/admissibility laws parallel the **Laws** row (at mechanism level).  
— **Graded/row‑polymorphic effects** (Granule, row‑effects): inform the **EffectDiscipline** vocabulary and equational laws.

**Profiles rationale (informative).**  
— **FormalSubstrate.** Captures *mathematical language + inference kinds + effect signatures* at the **concept plane**, ensuring the calculus stays independent from handler/realization choices; consuming mechanisms (A.6.1) provide **EffectRealization** only by reference.  
— **PrincipleFrame.** Captures *postulates/invariants + measurability intent (CHR binding)* without committing to **units/planes/Transport**, which are authored centrally in **UNM** so that comparisons remain lawful and edition‑pinned.

### A.6.0:10 - Relations

* **Specialises / is specialised by:** **A.6.1** (adds `OperationAlgebra` / `LawSet` / `AdmissibilityConditions` / `Transport` for mechanisms) and any domain‑profiled signature publications that preserve the four‑row Block.
* **Constrained by:** E.10 LEX‑BUNDLE (registers, strata); D.CTX for Context binding; **Part F** (Bridges & cross‑context transport; naming).
* **Consumed by (profiles):** **`U.FormalSubstrate`** and **`U.PrincipleFrame`** specialisations of `U.Signature` on the principled path; **UNM** (Context Normalization) remains the **single source of truth** for **CG‑Spec/ComparatorSet/Transport** editions that Signature consumers pin on faces.

* **Enables:** uniform authoring and comparison of signatures across Part C families, methods, and discipline glossaries (Part F).
