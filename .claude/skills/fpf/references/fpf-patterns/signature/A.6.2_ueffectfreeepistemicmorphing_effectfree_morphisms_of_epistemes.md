## A.6.2 - `U.EffectFreeEpistemicMorphing` — Effect‑free morphisms of epistemes

**One‑line summary.** `U.EffectFreeEpistemicMorphing` (EFEM) is the universal class of **effect‑free, law‑governed morphisms between epistemes**. An EFEM morphism rewrites episteme components (ClaimGraph, `describedEntityRef`, optional `groundingHolonRef`, `viewpointRef`, `referenceScheme`, and—where C.2.1+ is in use—`representationSchemeRef` and related slots, plus meta) in a **conservative, functorial, reproducible** way, with an explicit mode for what happens to the **DescribedEntitySlot** (`DescribedEntityChangeMode ∈ {preserve, retarget}`) as defined by `C.2.1 U.EpistemeSlotGraph`.

**Placement.** After **A.6.1 `U.Mechanism`** and before any specialisations (`A.6.3 U.EpistemicViewing`, `A.6.4 U.EpistemicRetargeting`).

**Builds on.**
A.6.0 `U.Signature` (subject/vocabulary/laws/applicability); A.6.1 `U.Mechanism`; A.6.5 `U.RelationSlotDiscipline`; C.2.1 `U.Episteme — Epistemes and their slot graph`; E.10.D2 (I/D/S discipline); C.3.* (Kind‑CAL / KindBridge for described‑entity classes).

**Used by.**
A.6.3 `U.EpistemicViewing`; A.6.4 `U.EpistemicRetargeting`; E.17.0 `U.MultiViewDescribing`; E.17 (MVPK); E.18 (E.TGA StructuralReinterpretation, Transduction graph).

### A.6.2:1 - Problem frame

FPF has many operations that **transform knowledge artifacts** without directly doing work in the world:

* turning an informal method description into a more formal specification;
* projecting a large system description into a smaller “for‑safety‑officer” view;
* re‑expressing the same behavioural model in a different calculus or notation;
* retargeting an analysis from “this subsystem” to “that subsystem” along a known KindBridge.

All of these are **episteme→episteme** transforms: they change what is written in an episteme, but they **do not themselves measure, execute, or actuate**. They are neither Work (A.15) nor Mechanisms in the A.6.1 sense; they are “pure morphisms over epistemes”.

Without a universal pattern for such morphisms:

* every family (KD‑CAL, E.TGA, MVPK, discipline packs) reinvent their own notion of “projection”, “reinterpretation”, or “refinement”;
* laws about what may change in an episteme (content vs described entity vs grounding holon vs reference plane) fragment across the spec;
* cross‑family reasoning (e.g. “this E.TGA StructuralReinterpretation is a retargeting, not a view”) becomes brittle and ad‑hoc.

### A.6.2:2 - Problem

Concretely, without EFEM:

1. **No single place for “effect‑free” discipline.**
   The distinction *“episteme‑only change”* vs *“Work in the world”* is already important (C.2.1 separates episteme components from Work and from presentation surfaces), but the laws for “episteme‑only” operations are scattered or implicit. 

2. **Described entity behaviour is unclear.**
   Many transforms **intend** to keep “what this episteme is about” fixed (viewing), others **intend** to change it under an invariant (retargeting). Without a common *DescribedEntityChangeMode* discipline we get silent breaks in “describedEntity”: an operation that looks like a harmless format change may in fact surreptitiously change the entity‑of‑interest.

3. **No functorial backbone.**
   MVPK, KD‑CAL and E.TGA all implicitly assume that episteme transforms **compose** and respect identities, but the conditions for this (purity, conservativity, idempotence, scope) are not formulated once and reused. Different parts of the spec repeat subtly different sets of laws.

4. **Slot/Ref confusion.**
   With the new `U.EpistemeSlotGraph` and `U.RelationSlotDiscipline`, every episteme now has explicit **SlotKind / ValueKind / RefKind** discipline. Laws for “projection” or “retargeting” that are written against “fields” or unnamed tuple components are now out of alignment.

The result: engineers and tool builders can no longer tell **when they are allowed to transform epistemes without changing what is being claimed about the world**, nor what needs to be witnessed by Bridges and CL‑penalties when describedEntity does change.

### A.6.2:3 - Forces

* **Epistemic purity vs operational power.**
  Effect‑free episteme transforms are attractive precisely because they can be reasoned about algebraically and composed freely. But the more operational power they are given (IO, solver calls, measurements), the less they remain “pure” and the more they belong under `U.Mechanism` / `U.WorkEnactment`.

* **Preserve vs retarget.**
  Viewing is describedEntity‑preserving; reinterpretation along a KindBridge is describedEntity‑retargenting. Both are important, but **they must be distinguished and witnessed differently**.

* **Conservativity vs usefulness.**
  EFEM should be **conservative**: no new intensional commitments beyond what input epistemes already entail. At the same time, we need transformations that can *factor*, *aggregate*, or *normalise* content, which may drop some information or change its representation.

* **Locality vs reference planes and Bridges.**
  Epistemes live on **reference planes** (C.2.1); cross‑plane and cross‑Context reasoning goes via Bridges and CL penalties (Part F/B.3). EFEM must respect this: it cannot smuggle plane changes or transport into “pure” content rewrites.

* **I/D/S strict distinction.**
  Intension (`I`) is not itself an episteme; `…Description` and `…Spec` are epistemes with a `DescriptionContext = ⟨DescribedEntityRef, BoundedContextRef, ViewpointRef⟩`. EFEM must support operations on D/S epistemes while keeping the I/D/S layering intact (A.7, E.10.D2).

### A.6.2:4 - Solution — define `U.EffectFreeEpistemicMorphing` once

#### A.6.2:4.1 - Informal definition

> **Definition.** A `U.EffectFreeEpistemicMorphing` (EFEM) is a class of **episteme→episteme morphisms** that:
>
> * operate **only** on the components of an episteme as fixed in `C.2.1 U.EpistemeSlotGraph` (ClaimGraph, slots for described entity, grounding holon, viewpoint, representation/reference schemes, meta); 
> * are **effect‑free** (no Work, no Mechanism application, no mutation of systems or carriers);
> * are **conservative** in what they claim about the described entity (no new intensional commitments beyond logical consequences under the declared ReferenceScheme);
> * are **functorial** (identities and composition behave as expected on the category of epistemes);
> * declare an explicit **DescribedEntityChangeMode ∈ {preserve, retarget}**, controlling how `DescribedEntitySlot` (and associated subjectRef) behaves.

The **objects** of the EFEM universe are epistemes of some `U.EpistemeKind` (typically realised as `U.EpistemeCard` / `U.EpistemeView` / `U.EpistemePublication`). The **arrows** are EFEM morphisms `f : X → Y` satisfying the P0–P5 laws below.

Specialisations:

* `U.EpistemicViewing` (A.6.3) — EFEM with `DescribedEntityChangeMode = preserve`.
* `U.EpistemicRetargeting` (A.6.4) — EFEM with `DescribedEntityChangeMode = retarget`, tied to KindBridges/ReferencePlanes.

#### A.6.2:4.2 - Signature Block (A.6.0 alignment)

As a `U.Signature`, EFEM publishes the following **SubjectBlock** and the standard four‑row block (“SubjectBlock / Vocabulary / Laws / Applicability”) from A.6.0, specialised to episteme→episteme morphisms.

**SubjectBlock**

```
SubjectBlock
  SubjectKind   = U.EffectFreeEpistemicMorphing
  BaseType      = ⟨X : U.Episteme, Y : U.Episteme⟩        // carrier pair (domain,codomain)
  Quantification= SliceSet:=U.ContextSliceSet; 
  ExtentRule:=admissibleEpistemeMorphisms // Context slices & admissible EFEM per slice
  ResultKind?   = U.Morphism                               // typed morphism f : X→Y
```

This says: EFEM is “about” **morphisms between epistemes**, indexed by Context slices; its results are morphisms of a declared type `U.Morphism` in the `Ep` category.

**Vocabulary (core operators & kinds)**

* **Types**
  * `U.Episteme` (as holon; realised via species `U.EpistemeCard`, `U.EpistemeView`, `U.EpistemePublication` under C.2.1).
  * `U.EpistemeKind` (episteme n‑ary relation signature; slots per A.6.5 / C.2.1).
  * `U.SubjectRef` (subject reference; for D/S epistemes this is `DescriptionContext = ⟨DescribedEntityRef, BoundedContextRef, ViewpointRef⟩` per IDS‑13 (DescriptionContext discipline; C.2.1 §6.1 / E.10.D2)).
  * `U.Morphism` (arrow in `Ep`).
  * `U.DescribedEntityChangeMode = {preserve, retarget}` (enumeration; no new Kernel type for “DescribedEntity”).

* **Operators (arrow algebra)**

  * `id_X : U.Morphism(X→X)` for any episteme `X`.
  * `compose(g,f) : U.Morphism(X→Z)` where `f : X→Y`, `g : Y→Z`.
  * `apply(f, x:U.Episteme) : U.Episteme`.
  * `dom(f), cod(f) : U.Episteme`.
  * `subjectRef(E) : U.SubjectRef`.
  * `describedEntityChangeMode(f) : U.DescribedEntityChangeMode`  // EFEM‑level characteristic from C.2.1.

Each operator that takes epistemes as arguments obeys **SlotSpec discipline** from A.6.5: in particular, laws below are phrased in terms of the **named SlotKinds** (`DescribedEntitySlot`, `GroundingHolonSlot`, `ClaimGraphSlot`, `ViewpointSlot`, `ReferenceSchemeSlot`, `ViewSlot`, and—when the C.2.1+ extension is used—`RepresentationSchemeSlot`) and their associated ValueKind/RefKind; we never speak of “field 1/2/3”.

**Laws row** and **Applicability** are given by P0–P5 and the Scope clause below.

#### A.6.2:4.3 - Laws P0–P5 (normative)

All laws below are **normative**: any morphism advertised as an instance of `U.EffectFreeEpistemicMorphing` SHALL satisfy them.

##### A.6.2:4.3.1 - P0 — Typed signature & component profile (C.2.1‑grounded)

For any EFEM morphism `f : X→Y`:

1. **Typed objects.** `X` and `Y` are epistemes of declared kinds `K_X, K_Y : U.EpistemeKind`, each with a SlotKind signature as per C.2.1 and A.6.5 (at least `DescribedEntitySlot`, `ClaimGraphSlot`, `ViewpointSlot?`, `RepresentationSchemeSlot?`, `ReferenceSchemeSlot?`; `GroundingHolonSlot?`, `ViewSlot?` where relevant).

2. **Component projection.** For each episteme `E`, EFEM laws may refer to:
   * `content(E) : U.ClaimGraph` — value of `ClaimGraphSlot` (stored **by value** in the minimal core);
   * `describedEntityRef(E) : U.EntityRef` — value of the RefKind for `DescribedEntitySlot`;
   * `groundingHolonRef?(E) : U.HolonRef` — if the episteme kind includes `GroundingHolonSlot`;
   * `viewpointRef?(E) : U.ViewpointRef` — if `ViewpointSlot` is present;
   * `referenceScheme?(E) : U.ReferenceScheme` — value of `ReferenceSchemeSlot` (stored **by value** in the minimal core);
   * `representationSchemeRef?(E) : U.RepresentationSchemeRef` — only for episteme kinds that use the C.2.1+ `RepresentationSchemeSlot`;
   * `meta(E)` — edition/provenance/status components (species‑level).

3. **Declared `DescribedEntityChangeMode`.**
   Each EFEM species **declares** a fixed `DescribedEntityChangeMode ∈ {preserve, retarget}`. At the level of individual morphisms:

   * if `describedEntityChangeMode(f) = preserve`, then `describedEntityRef(Y) = describedEntityRef(X)` (and usually `groundingHolonRef(Y) = groundingHolonRef(X)` unless an explicit Grounding Bridge is declared);
   * if `describedEntityChangeMode(f) = retarget`, then `describedEntityRef(Y) ≠ describedEntityRef(X)` in general and a **KindBridge** between the two described entities MUST be named (A.6.4 / F.9).

4. **SubjectRef compatibility.**
   For D/S epistemes (`…Description` / `…Spec`), `subjectRef(E)` is a `DescriptionContext = ⟨DescribedEntityRef, BoundedContextRef, ViewpointRef⟩` (E.10.D2). EFEM species SHALL state how `subjectRef` transforms in terms of these components (usually: preserve or explicitly adjust `ViewpointRef` while preserving `DescribedEntityRef` and `BoundedContextRef`).

##### A.6.2:4.4.2 - P1 — Purity (no external effects)

EFEM morphisms are **pure functions on epistemes**:
* Applying `f : X→Y` **does not**:
  * change any `U.System` or `U.Holon` state;
  * execute Work (`U.WorkEnactment`) or run a `U.Mechanism` (A.6.1) with operational guards;
  * mutate `U.PresentationCarrier` (files, databases, message buses, IDEs).
* The **only** state change introduced by EFEM is the replacement of input epistemes by output epistemes according to `apply(f, X) = Y`, with all component changes governed by P2–P5.

Any operation that requires **measurements, simulations, solver calls, or tool use with external side‑effects** SHALL be modelled as a `U.Mechanism`/`U.Work` that **produces new epistemes**, which may then be related by EFEM morphisms.

##### A.6.2:4.3.3 - P2 — Conservativity (no new intensional commitments)

Let `content_X = content(X)`, `content_Y = content(Y)`, with associated `referenceScheme_X`, `referenceScheme_Y`, `describedEntityRef_X`, `describedEntityRef_Y`, `groundingHolonRef_X`, `groundingHolonRef_Y`. Interpret each `content` via its `ReferenceScheme` and slots. Then:

> The set of **claims about the described entities** that can be read from `Y` **SHALL NOT introduce new atomic commitments** beyond those that are logical consequences of the claims read from `X`, possibly after applying a declared correspondence between representation/reference schemes.

Intuitively:

* EFEM may:
  * delete information (projection/abstraction);
  * normalise or re‑express information (e.g., reordering ClaimGraph, changing notation via a ReferenceScheme/RepresentationScheme correspondence);
  * add **meta‑claims about the episteme** itself (edition, source, status, witness entries).

* EFEM may **not**:
  * assert new atomic facts about the described entities or grounding holons beyond what is derivable from input ClaimGraphs under the declared ReferenceSchemes;
  * silently widen the scope of claims (e.g., treating local facts as global, changing Context or ReferencePlane without a Bridge).

Where `describedEntityChangeMode(f) = retarget`, conservativity is understood **relative to a declared invariant** of the KindBridge (A.6.4): e.g., conservation of energy for a Fourier transform, or preservation of functional behaviour for a structural reinterpretation.

##### A.6.2:4.3.4 - P3 — Functoriality (identity, composition, correspondence)

We work in the category **Ep** whose objects are epistemes (species of `U.Episteme`) and whose arrows are EFEM morphisms satisfying P0–P2, together with the functor

```
+α : Ep → Ref
```

that maps each episteme to the object it describes (value of `DescribedEntitySlot`, i.e. `describedEntityRef(E)`) as in the mathematical layer for epistemes. EFEM instances with `describedEntityChangeMode(f) = preserve` are **vertical morphisms** for α (`α(f) = id`), while those with `describedEntityChangeMode(f) = retarget` reindex along a declared `KindBridge` in **Ref**.

1. **Identities.** For each episteme `X`, there exists `id_X : X→X` such that:

   ```text
   apply(id_X, X) = X
   compose(id_Y, f) = f = compose(f, id_X)
   ```

   `id_X` preserves all components (`content`, `describedEntityRef`, `groundingHolonRef`, `viewpointRef`, `representationSchemeRef`, `referenceScheme`, `meta`).

2. **Composition.** For `f : X→Y`, `g : Y→Z`, the composite `h = compose(g,f)` is an EFEM morphism `X→Z` with:

   ```
   apply(h, X) = apply(g, apply(f, X))
   describedEntityChangeMode(h) = combine(describedEntityChangeMode(f), describedEntityChangeMode(g))   // as per species-specific rules
   ```

and P0–P2 hold for `h`. For example, two `preserve` morphisms compose to `preserve`; `preserve` after `retarget` is `retarget` if the KindBridge composition exists.

3. **Correspondence‑aware composition.**
   When EFEM changes `RepresentationScheme` or `ReferenceScheme`, a **CorrespondenceModel** (as in C.2.1 §6 and E.17) may be needed to witness commutativity: composition MUST respect these correspondences up to declared isomorphism/oplax naturality (witness epistemes may be recorded in `meta`).

##### A.6.2:4.3.5 - P4 — Idempotence & determinism (on fixed configuration)

For any EFEM morphism `f : X→Y` with fixed configuration (episteme kinds, `DescribedEntityChangeMode` characteristic, KindBridge/CorrespondenceModel where needed):

1. **Determinism.**
   For the same input episteme `X` (identical content, slots, meta), `apply(f, X)` yields the same output episteme `Y` up to declared structural equivalence (normal forms, alpha‑renaming etc.). There is no dependence on ambient time, randomness, network state, or solver heuristics unless these are **encoded as explicit inputs**.

2. **Idempotence (up to declared equivalence).**
   Re‑applying the same EFEM to its own output yields no further essential change:

   ```text
   apply(f, apply(f, X)) ≅ apply(f, X)
   ```

   where `≅` denotes the structural equivalence declared for the episteme kinds in question (e.g., ClaimGraph normalisation).

Species MAY weaken idempotence to “idempotent after normalisation”; if so, the normalisation step MUST itself be specified as an EFEM morphism and the composite be idempotent.

##### A.6.2:4.3.6 - P5 — Applicability, scope & compatibility

Each EFEM species **publishes** an Applicability clause:

* **EoI / described entity class.**
  A constraint on the allowed ValueKind of `DescribedEntitySlot` (via `EoIClass ⊑ U.Entity`): e.g., “epistemes describing `U.Holon` that are systems of type X”.

* **Grounding holon & Context.**
  Constraints on `GroundingHolonSlot` and `U.BoundedContext`: where the morphism is valid (lab, runtime environment, organisational context).

* **Representation/ReferenceSchemes.**
  Enumerates supported `RepresentationScheme`/`ReferenceScheme` pairs and any required CorrespondenceModels.

* **Viewpoint discipline.**
  For Descr/Spec epistemes, EFEM SHALL specify which `U.Viewpoint`s (E.17.0) it supports and how it interacts with `U.MultiViewDescribing` families (e.g., “works only on engineering viewpoints from TEVB” or “viewpoint‑agnostic normalisation”).

Applying EFEM **outside** its Applicability (e.g., wrong EoIClass, missing grounding holon, incompatible Viewpoint) is **non‑conformant**: a conformant implementation MUST reject such attempts or model them as different mechanisms/works, not as EFEM.

Cross‑Context or cross‑plane use (changing `U.BoundedContext` or `ReferencePlane`) is **not part of EFEM**; it is handled by Bridges (Part F) and A.6.1 transport, which then feed new epistemes into EFEM.

### A.6.2:5 - Archetypal Grounding (Tell–Show–Show)

The examples below show how EFEM is intended to be used across I/D/S and Viewpoint/MVPK layers.

#### A.6.2:5.1 - Typed formalisation `Specify_DS : D→S` (species of EFEM)

*Context.* You have an informal `U.MethodDescription` for a safety check and want a more formal `U.MethodSpec` with test harness obligations, but **about the same method**.

*Shape.*

* Domain: `X = U.MethodDescription` episteme with
  `describedEntityRef(X) : U.MethodRef`, `content(X) : U.ClaimGraph_D`, `viewpointRef(X)` an engineering viewpoint (TEVB), `ReferenceScheme_D`.
* Codomain: `Y = U.MethodSpec` episteme with the **same** `describedEntityRef(Y) = describedEntityRef(X)`, `viewpointRef(Y) = viewpointRef(X)`, more structured `content(Y) : U.ClaimGraph_S`, stronger ReferenceScheme (explicit pre/post, obligations).

`Specify_DS` is a species of EFEM:

* `describedEntityChangeMode(Specify_DS) = preserve`.
* P1 — effect‑free: it transforms epistemes only.
* P2 — conservative: any behavioural claims in the Spec must be logically entailed by the informal Description and the underlying Method Intension; if the spec makes stronger claims, that is modelled as creating a **new Intension with its own D/S pair**, not as a valid EFEM instance.
* P3–P5 — functorial and scoped: specs compose, applicability bound to the appropriate engineering context and Viewpoints.

This matches A.7/E.10.D2 strict distinction: I→D (`Describe_ID`) is not itself an episteme→episteme morphism, but `Specify_DS` is; EFEM supplies its laws.

#### A.6.2:5.2 - Internal normalisation of a View (species of EFEM, `describedEntityChangeMode = preserve`)

*Context.* In MVPK you compute a engineering view `V` of a system description; you then normalise the view (sort, factor, put equations into normal form) without changing what it says.

Let `X = V_raw`, `Y = V_norm`, both `U.EpistemeView` instances with the same:

* `describedEntityRef(X) = describedEntityRef(Y)` (same system);
* `groundingHolonRef(X) = groundingHolonRef(Y)` (same environment);
* `viewpointRef(X) = viewpointRef(Y)` (same Viewpoint);
* `representationSchemeRef(X) = representationSchemeRef(Y)` (same notation).

The EFEM `NormalizeView : X→Y`:

* has `describedEntityChangeMode(NormalizeView) = preserve`;
* changes only `content` and maybe `meta` (e.g. “normalised at edition E”);
* is idempotent and deterministic (P4);
* is conservative (P2): no new claims, only re‑expression.

MVPK can then **assume** functoriality of such normalisations without re‑stating the EFEM laws.

#### A.6.2:5.3 - Retargeting sketch (bridge‑backed, `describedEntityChangeMode = retarget`)

*Context.* E.TGA’s StructuralReinterpretation maps a physical layout view into a functional behaviour view, changing the described entity from “physical module assembly” to “functional graph” along a KindBridge.

Inside EFEM, this becomes a species with `describedEntityChangeMode = retarget`:
* input episteme describes `S₁` (e.g. a component hierarchy holon);
* output episteme describes `S₂` (e.g. a functional network holon);
* a declared `KindBridge(S₁,S₂)` and invariant (e.g. behavioural equivalence) provide the semantic glue;
* P2 conservativity is checked **w.r.t. that invariant**.

The details belong to A.6.4/E.TGA; EFEM provides the generic discipline.

#### A.6.2:5.4 - Worked SlotSpec example (engineering SystemDescription episteme kind)
*(informative)*

To make the SlotKind/ValueKind/RefKind discipline and EFEM laws concrete, consider a simple engineering `U.EpistemeKind` for system descriptions over `EoIClass ⊑ U.Entity` with `EoIClass = U.System` in a given Context. A minimal SlotSpec table for such a kind could be:

| SlotKind              | ValueKind                                     | RefKind / refMode   | Notes                                                                 |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DescribedEntitySlot` | `U.Entity` (constrained by `EoIClass = U.System`) | `U.EntityRef`    | describes which system the episteme is about                          |
| `GroundingHolonSlot`  | `U.Holon`                                     | `U.HolonRef`        | plant / runtime SoS grounding measurements and validation             |
| `ClaimGraphSlot`      | `U.ClaimGraph`                                | ByValue             | KD‑CAL/LOG‑CAL ClaimGraph for the description or spec                 |
| `ViewpointSlot`       | `U.Viewpoint`                                 | `U.ViewpointRef`    | engineering viewpoint (e.g. from TEVB) under which D/S are validated |
| `ReferenceSchemeSlot` | `U.ReferenceScheme`                           | ByValue             | how the ClaimGraph is read against described entity and grounding     |

This table is an instance of A.6.5 `U.RelationSlotDiscipline`: each row is a SlotSpec triple ⟨SlotKind, ValueKind, refMode/RefKind⟩; no additional kernel types are introduced, and C.2.1’s constraints on `DescribedEntitySlot`/`GroundingHolonSlot` are preserved.

Two typical EFEM species over this kind are:
* `Specify_DS_Sys : SystemDescription → SystemSpec` — a `DescribedEntityChangeMode = preserve` species that:
  * **reads** `DescribedEntitySlot`, `GroundingHolonSlot`, `ViewpointSlot`, `ReferenceSchemeSlot` and **writes** a refined `ClaimGraphSlot` and possibly a strengthened `ReferenceSchemeSlot`;
  * satisfies P2 by only adding claims that are logical consequences of the original description plus the fixed Intension (A.7/E.10.D2);
  * satisfies CC‑C.2.1‑5 by explicitly declaring its slot profile and change mode.

* `Normalize_EngView : EpistemeView → EpistemeView` — a view‑normalisation EFEM (again with `DescribedEntityChangeMode = preserve`) that:
  * **reads** all slots and **writes** only `ClaimGraphSlot` (normal form) and `meta`;
  * is idempotent and deterministic (P4) and pure (P1);
  * is conservative (P2) by construction: it never introduces new atoms about the described system.

In later A.6.3/A.6.4/E.17.\* patterns, concrete EpistemeKinds (for specific engineering description/specification idioms) are expected to provide SlotSpecs of this general shape and to state explicitly, per CC‑C.2.1‑5 / CC‑EFEM.\*, which slots their EFEM species read and write.

### A.6.2:6 - Bias & Defaults (informative)

* **Episteme‑first, world‑second.** EFEM is strictly about **epistemes as objects**; any world contact (measurements, executions) lives in `U.Mechanism`/`U.Work` and produces new epistemes that EFEM may subsequently relate.

* **SlotKinds, not “fields”.** Laws talk about `DescribedEntitySlot`, `GroundingHolonSlot`, etc., and their ValueKind/RefKind, as per A.6.5 and C.2.1; they never use unnamed tuple positions or “role 1/2/3”. This keeps EFEM aligned with the slot discipline used for methods, roles, services, and other n‑ary relations.

* **Local‑first semantics.** EFEM is **Context‑local**; crossings of Context or ReferencePlane are always delegated to Bridges / A.6.1 transport (with CL penalties to `R/R_eff` only). No “implicit cross‑Context EFEM” is permitted.

* **I/D/S respect.** EFEM never collapses Intension with Description/Spec: I→D and D→S operations are typed explicitly and either (i) conform to EFEM laws where they are episteme→episteme, or (ii) remain separate morphism classes (A.7) while being described as EFEM‑conformant.

| **CC‑EFEM.1 (Typed episteme objects).**             | Every morphism advertised as `U.EffectFreeEpistemicMorphing` SHALL have domain and codomain epistemes whose kinds (`U.EpistemeKind`) publish SlotKinds/ValueKinds/RefKinds according to C.2.1 and A.6.5 (at least `DescribedEntitySlot` and `ClaimGraphSlot`; other slots as declared).                                                                                                               |
| **CC‑EFEM.2 (Declared DescribedEntityChangeMode).** | Each EFEM **species** SHALL declare the `DescribedEntityChangeMode` characteristic `describedEntityChangeMode : U.Morphism → {preserve, retarget}` as per C.2.1. For every instance `f`, `describedEntityChangeMode(f)` MUST be either `preserve` (⇒ `describedEntityRef` unchanged) or `retarget` (⇒ a KindBridge and invariant are explicitly named; see A.6.4 / F.9).                                                                                         |
| **CC‑EFEM.3 (Purity).**                             | EFEM morphisms SHALL be effect‑free: they MUST NOT directly perform Work or run mechanisms with operational guards; they only read input epistemes and construct output epistemes consistent with P2–P5. Any use of external solvers/measurements MUST be modelled as separate Mechanisms/Work that feed new epistemes into EFEM.                                                                     |
| **CC‑EFEM.4 (Conservativity).**                     | Laws for EFEM species SHALL state their conservativity regime: claims in the output MUST be logical consequences of input claims under declared ReferenceSchemes and any CorrespondenceModels/KindBridges. If an operation may strengthen claims (e.g. add commitments not entailed by inputs), it is **not** EFEM and MUST be modelled separately.                                                   |
| **CC‑EFEM.5 (Functoriality & idempotence).**        | EFEM species SHALL support identity and composition with the usual category laws, and SHALL specify any structural equivalence under which idempotence holds. Non‑deterministic or order‑sensitive behaviour (beyond declared structural equivalences) is non‑conformant.                                                                                                                             |
| **CC‑EFEM.6 (Applicability & scope).**              | Each EFEM species SHALL publish Applicability in terms of: allowed EoI classes (ValueKind for `DescribedEntitySlot`), Context/BoundedContext and grounding holon constraints, supported Viewpoints and representation/reference schemes. Applying EFEM outside this Applicability (including cross‑Context or cross‑plane) is non‑conformant. Crossings MUST be delegated to Bridges/A.6.1 transport. |
| **CC‑EFEM.7 (I/D/S & subjectRef discipline).**      | For any episteme that is a `…Description`/`…Spec` (E.10.D2), EFEM laws SHALL be phrased in terms of `DescriptionContext = ⟨DescribedEntityRef, BoundedContextRef, ViewpointRef⟩` and MUST respect the I/D/S discipline **and** DescriptionContext invariants (including IDS‑13 Viewpoint‑locality as defined in E.10.D2/C.2.1): `Describe_ID` lives in A.7; `Specify_DS` MAY be species of EFEM but MUST preserve Intension. |
| **CC‑EFEM.8 (Slot‑level read/write declaration).**  | Any EFEM species that defines morphisms between epistemes SHALL also satisfy C.2.1 checkpoint CC‑C.2.1‑5: it MUST state whether it is a species of `U.EffectFreeEpistemicMorphing`/`U.EpistemicViewing`/`U.EpistemicRetargeting`, declare its `describedEntityChangeMode`, name which SlotKinds it reads and writes, and state its behaviour on `describedEntityRef`, `groundingHolonRef`, `viewpointRef`, and `referenceScheme`. |

### A.6.2:8 - SoTA‑Echoing (informative, lineage)

EFEM is intentionally “thin”: it provides a **minimal categorical and slot‑based discipline** for episteme→episteme morphisms, making it easy to align with several post‑2015 lines of work:

* **Categorical semantics & displayed categories.**
  Treating `Ep` as a category over `Ref` via a functor `α : Ep → Ref` (mapping each episteme to its described entity) matches the *displayed categories* view on fibrations: EFEM arrows are those morphisms in `Ep` that are “vertical” (preserve α) or “structured reindexings” (retarget under a KindBridge). This is exactly the intended alignment with C.2.1’s subjectRef/ReferencePlane picture.

* **Optics as universal projections.**
  Viewing operations (`U.EpistemicViewing`) refine EFEM in a way analogous to **lenses/prisms/traversals** in the optics literature: effect‑free, compositional accessors for parts of a larger structure. EFEM captures the laws that underlie those projections (purity, conservation, functoriality); optics‑style constructions can then be used inside discipline packs without modifying the core.

* **Structured cospans & correspondences.**
  Many correspondence‑based multi‑view patterns (ISO 42010 correspondences, model synchronisation, traceability links) can be seen as spans/cospans between epistemes. EFEM ensures that the legs of such cospans are effect‑free and conservative, while CorrespondenceModels carry the extra structure needed for consistency management.

* **Bidirectional transformations (BX).**
  The “no new commitments” and “functorial & idempotent” constraints mirror modern BX practice around **consistency restoration**: EFEM is the universal core that BX‑like constructions (view updates, synchronisers) must respect when instantiated for epistemes.

EFEM does *not* prescribe a specific calculus (deductive, probabilistic, latent‑space), nor a specific representation (symbolic vs distributed); those choices are captured in `U.ClaimGraph`, `U.RepresentationScheme` and discipline‑level patterns. EFEM only says what it means to transform epistemes **legally** in that chosen substrate.

### A.6.2:9 - Consequences

* **Single place for episteme‑to‑episteme laws.**
  All effect‑free transforms of knowledge artefacts, across KD‑CAL, MVPK, E.TGA, discipline packs, can now be defined as species of EFEM, instead of each family re‑inventing its own law set.

* **Clear separation from mechanisms & work.**
  Anything that touches the world (measurements, execution, simulation) is forced into `U.Mechanism` / `U.WorkEnactment`, with CL‑penalised Bridges and Γ_time; EFEM remains pure and compositional.

* **Stable backbone for Viewing & Retargeting.**
  A.6.3 and A.6.4 do not need to repeat P0–P5; they specialise EFEM with additional constraints (preserve/retarget). Other patterns (e.g. MultiViewDescribing, MVPK, E.TGA StructuralReinterpretation) can depend on EFEM as a stable base.

* **Slot‑level clarity.**
  By formulating EFEM laws in terms of SlotKinds/ValueKinds/RefKinds (A.6.5) and the EpistemeSlotGraph (C.2.1), it becomes much harder for Episteme to confuse “object of talk”, “slot in a relation”, and “reference to that object”.

* **Better didactics.**
  The old “semantic triangle” becomes a didactic projection of EFEM over the EpistemeSlotGraph: EFEM + C.2.1 explain precisely what the triangle was trying to gesture at (symbol, concept, object), while correctly foregrounding operations, viewpoints, grounding holons, and reference schemes.

### A.6.2:10 - Rationale

**Why a separate EFEM pattern (A.6.2) instead of folding into A.6.1 or C.2.1?**

* A.6.1 governs **Mechanisms** (operations with AdmissibilityConditions, Γ_time, transport and Bridges)—too operational for the pure episteme transforms we want here.
* C.2.1 fixes the **ontology of epistemes** (slots, components, ReferencePlane), but does not talk about morphisms. EFEM is explicitly a **morphism‑level** pattern over that ontology.

This split mirrors how Signature (A.6.0) separates “what is declared” from “how it is realised”: C.2.1 says what an episteme is; A.6.2 says what a legal episteme→episteme transform is.

**Why insist on DescribedEntityChangeMode?**

Because almost all subtle errors in multi‑view reasoning show up as **silent retargeting**: a transform that appears to keep the same object‑of‑talk actually changes it (e.g., from “component assembly” to “function bundle”) without naming the bridge or invariant. By forcing every species to declare `preserve` vs `retarget`, EFEM makes those decisions explicit and reviewable.

**Why attach EFEM to SlotKinds instead of informal “fields”?**

FPF already committed to a single SlotKind/ValueKind/RefKind discipline (A.6.5) across relations, methods, roles, and now epistemes. Re‑using that discipline here:

* aligns episteme morphisms with the rest of the framework;
* enables later mechanised checks (e.g., that a viewing only touches slots it promised to touch);
* avoids minting yet another notion of “parameter” or “role in a relation”.

### A.6.2:11 - Relations

* **Specialises / is specialised by.**

  * Builds on A.6.0 `U.Signature` and A.6.1 `U.Mechanism` for the uniform SubjectBlock/vocabulary/laws/applicability structure.
  * Specialised by A.6.3 `U.EpistemicViewing` (describedEntity‑preserving EFEM) and A.6.4 `U.EpistemicRetargeting` (describedEntity‑retargering EFEM).

* **Constrained by.**
  A.6.5 `U.RelationSlotDiscipline` (SlotKind/ValueKind/RefKind); C.2.1 `U.EpistemeSlotGraph` (episteme components, ReferencePlane); E.10.D2 (I/D/S discipline); Part F (Bridges, CL, ReferencePlane crossings); E.10 (LEX‑BUNDLE naming rules, especially on `…Slot` / `…Ref` and ban on Subject/Object in episteme tech names).

* **Consumed by.**
  E.17.0 `U.MultiViewDescribing` (families of D/S epistemes under Viewpoints); E.17 (MVPK — publication as species of Viewing/EFEM); E.18 (E.TGA StructuralReinterpretation and other transductions over epistemes); KD‑CAL/LOG‑CAL rules that reason about episteme transforms categorically.
