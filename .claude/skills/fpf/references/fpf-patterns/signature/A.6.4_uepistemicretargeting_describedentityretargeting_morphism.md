## A.6.4 - `U.EpistemicRetargeting` — describedEntity‑retargeting morphism

**One‑line summary.** `U.EpistemicRetargeting` is the **describedEntity‑retargetning** species of `U.EffectFreeEpistemicMorphing`: an effect‑free episteme→episteme morphism that **intentionally changes what the episteme is about** (the occupant of `DescribedEntitySlot` in C.2.1) under a declared `KindBridge` and invariant, while remaining conservative with respect to that invariant.

**Placement.** After **A.6.3 `U.EpistemicViewing`**, before **A.6.5 `U.RelationSlotDiscipline`**. 

**Builds on.**
A.6.0 `U.Signature`; A.6.2 `U.EffectFreeEpistemicMorphing`; A.6.3 `U.EpistemicViewing`; A.6.5 `U.RelationSlotDiscipline`; A.7/E.10.D2 (I/D/S discipline, `DescriptionContext`); C.2.1 `U.Episteme — Epistemes and their slot graph`; C.2/C.3 (KD‑CAL/LOG‑CAL, ReferencePlane, Kind‑level reasoning); F.9 (Bridges, `KindBridge`, CL/CL^plane, SquareLaw witnesses).

**Used by.**
E.18 (E.TGA StructuralReinterpretation and other reinterpretation nodes); discipline packs for signal/spectrum transforms, data↔model retargetings, abstraction/refinement under kind‑invariants; KD‑CAL/LOG‑CAL retargeting rules; future species for architecture and governance reinterpretations. 

### A.6.4:1 - Problem frame

Many important operations on descriptions **change the object‑of‑talk** while preserving a structural or behavioural invariant:

* **Physical vs functional reinterpretation.**
  An episteme about a physical module (cabinet, rack, device) is re‑interpreted as an episteme about a function‑holon it realises. This is precisely what StructuralReinterpretation nodes in E.TGA attempt to do. 

* **Signal vs spectrum.**
  A time‑domain signal description is re‑targeted to a description of its frequency‑domain spectrum. The underlying invariant (typically energy or inner‑product) is preserved, but the “thing we talk about” changes from `time→value` trajectories to `frequency→amplitude/phase` distributions. 

* **Data vs model.**
  An episteme about raw observations (dataset) is turned into an episteme about a learned or estimated model, keeping an invariant such as likelihood, sufficient statistics, or predictive performance. 

All of these are **Ep→Ep transforms** that:
* do **not** change the Intension (`I`) directly (they operate on descriptions/specifications),
* do **not** merely slice or re‑express an episteme of the same entity (that would be EpistemicViewing, A.6.3),
* but **do change** the **DescribedEntity‑bundle** (`DescribedEntitySlot` and usually `GroundingHolonSlot`) under a formal bridge between kinds.

We need a single, reusable notion of **“epistemic retargeting”** that captures these operations as:
* **effect‑free** at the level of Work/Mechanism (EFEM discipline),
* **describedEntity‑retargeotating** in a controlled way,
* **invariant‑conservative** (no violation of the declared invariant between kinds),
* and **functorial** (retargetings compose cleanly and align with Bridges).

### A.6.4:2 - Problem

Without a dedicated pattern for EpistemicRetargeting:
1. **Retargeting is silently confused with viewing.**
   Structural reinterpretations (e.g., component→function, signal→spectrum, data→model) can be mistakenly treated as “just another view” of the same entity, even though they change `describedEntityRef`. This hides the fact that the **object‑of‑talk** has changed and that a `KindBridge` and invariant are required.

2. **Invariants float untyped.**
   Fourier‑style moves, structural reinterpretations, and abstraction/refinement steps are often justified by “energy is preserved”, “this component realises that function”, or “this model summarises those data” — but these invariants are not connected to the episteme morphism class. Without a dedicated species:

   * invariants live only in text,
   * CL‑penalties and ReferencePlane crossings cannot be tracked systematically (Part F).

3. **Cross‑kind reasoning has no canonical morphism.**
   A general EFEM (A.6.2) can change `describedEntityRef` by setting `describedEntityChangeMode = retarget`, but:

   * nothing states what that means at the level of kinds (`Kind(describedEntityRef(X))` vs `Kind(describedEntityRef(Y))`),
   * nothing connects these moves to `KindBridge` and ReferencePlane policies.

4. **StructuralReinterpretation is ad‑hoc.**
   E.TGA currently hosts StructuralReinterpretation as a special node, but its semantics are much closer to a generic “retargeting under a bridge” pattern than to something specific to graph‑based architectures. Without a core pattern:

   * StructuralReinterpretation risks duplicating retargeting logic,
   * other discipline packs may reinvent their own ad‑hoc re‑targetings.

5. **I/D/S discipline is left underspecified.**
   For descriptions/specifications (`…Description` / `…Spec`), retargeting **changes `DescribedEntityRef` in `DescriptionContext = ⟨DescribedEntityRef, BoundedContextRef, ViewpointRef⟩`** (E.10.D2), but must say what happens to context and viewpoint. Without an explicit pattern, these decisions get scattered across different E‑patterns instead of being governed centrally. 

### A.6.4:3 - Forces

* **Changing the object‑of‑talk vs constructing something new.**
  Retargeting should express **“talking about a different but bridge‑related entity”**, not arbitrary construction of a new Intension/episteme. The invariant lives **across** the pair of entities, not inside a single episteme.

* **Invariants may be lossy but must be explicit.**
  A retargeting is often **lossy** (e.g. data→model, signal→spectrum, structural→functional view), but:

  * it must preserve an explicitly declared invariant (energy, behaviour, statistics),
  * any additional strengthening must be modelled as a change of Intension plus new D/S, not as a hidden side‑effect.

* **Bridges and CL‑penalties.**
  Retargeting often crosses:
  * Kind‑planes (different `Kind(U.Entity)`),
  * ReferencePlanes (different observability or abstraction regimes).
    Part F already has `KindBridge`, plane Bridges and CL‑penalties; EpistemicRetargeting must **re‑use** them instead of introducing its own notion of “link”.

* **Functors over `α : Ep → Ref`.**
  In the fibred view of epistemes (C.2 / A.6.2), `α : Ep → Ref` maps each episteme to its described entity. EpistemicViewing preserves α (`α(v) = id`). Retargeting must:
  * change α in a controlled way (`α(r) = b : R₁→R₂` in `Ref`),
  * align with `KindBridge` and plane Bridges used for those base arrows.

* **Slot discipline and modularity.**
  C.2.1 and A.6.5 give epistemes a precise `SlotKind`/`ValueKind`/`RefKind` structure, including `DescribedEntitySlot` and `GroundingHolonSlot`. Retargeting laws must be stated **at the slot level**, not on ad‑hoc “fields”, so they can be reused across E.TGA, MVPK, and discipline packs.

### A.6.4:4 - Solution — `U.EpistemicRetargeting` as EFEM profile (`describedEntityChangeMode = retarget`)

#### A.6.4:4.1 - Informal definition

> **Definition (informal).**
> `U.EpistemicRetargeting` is the **describedEntity‑retargeting species** of `U.EffectFreeEpistemicMorphing`.
> A `U.EpistemicRetargeting r : X→Y`:
>
> * takes an input episteme `X` and produces an output episteme `Y`,
> * **changes** the occupant of `DescribedEntitySlot` (`describedEntityRef(Y) ≠ describedEntityRef(X)`),
> * relates the kinds of the old and new described entities via an explicit `KindBridge` in the appropriate ReferencePlane,
> * preserves a declared **invariant** across the pair of entities (e.g. energy, behaviour, sufficient statistics),
> * is **effect‑free** at the level of Work/Mechanism (EFEM discipline),
> * and composes functorially with other retargetings and viewings.

In C.2.1 terms, `U.EpistemicRetargeting` **re‑indexes** an episteme along a base‑level bridge: it moves the `DescribedEntitySlot` (and often the `<DescribedEntitySlot, GroundingHolonSlot>` bundle) along a `KindBridge`, while re‑expressing `content : U.ClaimGraph` and `referenceScheme` so that the declared invariant continues to hold at the new target. 

#### A.6.4:4.2 - Signature (A.6.0 / A.6.5 alignment)

**Signature header.**
`U.EpistemicRetargeting` is a **Morphism‑kind** under A.6.0, specialised from EFEM:

```
SubjectBlock
  SubjectKind    = U.EpistemicRetargeting
  BaseType       = ⟨X:U.Episteme, Y:U.Episteme⟩      // carrier pair
  Quantification = SliceSet := U.ContextSliceSet;
                   ExtentRule := admissible retargeting morphisms
  ResultKind     = U.Morphism                        // an instance r
```

**Vocabulary (re‑uses A.6.2).**

* **Types.** `U.Episteme`, `U.SubjectRef`, `U.Morphism`, `U.EpistemicRetargeting`.
* **Operators.**

  * `id    : U.Morphism(X→X)`
  * `compose(g,f) : U.Morphism(X→Z)` where `f:X→Y`, `g:Y→Z`
  * `apply(r, x:U.Episteme) : U.Episteme`
  * `dom(r), cod(r) : U.Episteme`
  * `subjectRef(-) : U.SubjectRef`
* **Slot‑level discipline.**
  Domain and codomain epistemes are instances of some `U.Episteme` species (typically `U.EpistemeCard`, `U.EpistemeView`, or `U.EpistemePublication`) whose episteme kinds each provide SlotSpecs (A.6.5) including at least:

  * `DescribedEntitySlot` (ValueKind `U.Entity`, RefKind `U.EntityRef`, usually restricted to an `EoIClass ⊑ U.Entity`),
  * `GroundingHolonSlot?` (ValueKind `U.Holon`, RefKind `U.HolonRef`),
  * `ClaimGraphSlot` (ValueKind `U.ClaimGraph`, by‑value),
  * `ViewpointSlot?` (ValueKind `U.Viewpoint`, RefKind `U.ViewpointRef`),
  * `ReferenceSchemeSlot` (ValueKind `U.ReferenceScheme`, by‑value),
  * and, where C.2.1+ is in use, `RepresentationSchemeSlot`, `ViewSlot` and related slots.

The pattern only requires **SlotSpec compatibility** between domain and codomain kinds (in the sense of A.6.5); they need not be literally the same kind.

**Relation to EFEM and Viewing.**

* Every `U.EpistemicRetargeting` is an **EFEM morphism** with `describedEntityChangeMode = retarget` in the sense of A.6.2/C.2.1.
* It **inherits** EFEM laws P0–P5 and adds retargeting‑specific obligations ER‑0…ER‑6 below.
* `U.EpistemicViewing` (A.6.3) covers the complementary case `describedEntityChangeMode = preserve`, where the object‑of‑talk does not change.

#### A.6.4:4.3 - Laws (ER‑0…ER‑6, over C.2.1 components)

All laws below are **in addition** to A.6.2’s EFEM laws P0–P5 and SHALL be read directly against C.2.1 components and A.6.5 SlotSpecs. 

**ER‑0 - Species & DescribedEntityChangeMode.**

* Any morphism `r:X→Y` declared as `U.EpistemicRetargeting` **MUST**:
  * be a species of `U.EffectFreeEpistemicMorphing` (A.6.2), and
  * declare `describedEntityChangeMode(r) = retarget`.
* Consequently:
 * the pair `<DescribedEntitySlot, GroundingHolonSlot>` is the **target bundle** for the change (as in C.2.1 §7.3: DescribedEntity‑bundle retargeting),
 * `DescribedEntitySlot` is **write‑enabled** (unlike Viewing) but only under the constraints below,
  * there exist entities `T₁, T₂ : U.Entity` such that:
    * `describedEntityRef(X) = T₁`,
    * `describedEntityRef(Y) = T₂`,
    * `T₁ ≠ T₂` (as Ref/identity), and
    * `Kind(T₁)` and `Kind(T₂)` are related by a `KindBridge` in Part F’s sense (with declared CL^k). 

**ER‑1 - Typed domain/codomain & DescribedEntity‑bundle behaviour.**

For any `r:X→Y` in `U.EpistemicRetargeting`:

1. `X` and `Y` are instances of `U.Episteme` species whose episteme kinds both realise at least the core C.2.1 slots (`DescribedEntitySlot`, `GroundingHolonSlot?`, `ClaimGraphSlot`, `ViewpointSlot?`, `ReferenceSchemeSlot`) and obey A.6.5.

2. At the SlotKind level:

   * `DescribedEntitySlot`:
     * **MUST change** (`describedEntityRef(Y) ≠ describedEntityRef(X)`),
     * the ValueKinds for the slot in the domain and codomain kinds **MUST** be related via an `EoIClass` pair that the `KindBridge` covers (e.g. `PhysicalModule` ↔ `FunctionHolon`, `Signal` ↔ `Spectrum`, `Dataset` ↔ `StatisticalModel`). 

   * `GroundingHolonSlot`, if present:
     * is either preserved exactly (`groundingHolonRef(Y) = groundingHolonRef(X)`), or
     * changed only along a declared holon‑Bridge in the same ReferencePlane (for example, moving from one runtime to another under a deployment bridge) with CL^plane penalties recorded in Part F.

   * `ViewpointSlot`, if present:
     * is either preserved, or
     * changed only within a declared `U.ViewpointBundle` (E.17.1/E.17.2), with the corresponding `CorrespondenceModel` explaining how the invariant is maintained under the new viewpoint.

1. For any episteme that is a `…Description`/`…Spec` (E.10.D2), `subjectRef` decodes to `DescriptionContext = ⟨DescribedEntityRef, BoundedContextRef, ViewpointRef⟩`. Under EpistemicRetargeting:
   * `DescribedEntityRef` **MUST** change from `T₁` to `T₂` as in ER‑0,
   * `BoundedContextRef` is:
     * either preserved, or
     * changed along an explicit Context‑Bridge (E.10.D1, Part F),
   * `ViewpointRef` is treated as in (2) above (preserved or mapped within a bundle), and any resulting change in admissible claims is governed by ER‑2.

The pair `<DescribedEntitySlot, GroundingHolonSlot>` is treated as a **target bundle**: many practical retargetings work at the level of this bundle rather than DescribedEntity alone, especially in E.TGA. 

**ER‑2 - Invariant‑based conservativity (lossy but lawful).**

Let `X` and `Y = apply(r,X)` with:
* `describedEntityRef(X) = T₁`, `describedEntityRef(Y) = T₂`,
* `KindBridge(T₁,T₂)` and associated invariant `Inv` declared for this species (e.g. energy, behavioural relation, likelihood),
* `content_X`, `referenceScheme_X`,
* `content_Y`, `referenceScheme_Y`,
* `groundingHolonRef_X`, `groundingHolonRef_Y`.

Then:
1. There MUST exist a KD‑CAL/LOG‑CAL expression of `Inv` such that:
   * all claims about `Inv` that can be derived by reading `content_Y` through `referenceScheme_Y` relative to `<T₂, groundingHolonRef_Y>`
     **are entailed by**
     claims about `Inv` derivable from `content_X` through `referenceScheme_X` relative to `<T₁, groundingHolonRef_X>`. 

2. Retargeting, as an EFEM instance, **may**:
   * discard information not needed to maintain `Inv` (lossy summarisation),
   * change representation schemes (e.g. time vs frequency domain),
   * move to different abstraction levels or ReferencePlanes (with Bridges and CL penalties declared),
   but **MUST NOT** violate the declared invariant.

3. Any intended change that **strengthens** commitments about `Inv` beyond what is derivable from `X` **is not a valid EpistemicRetargeting**. It must be modelled as:
   * a change of Intension (new D/S pair under A.7/E.10.D2), or
   * a chain of retargetings and Intension updates explicitly recorded in KD‑CAL/LOG‑CAL.

**ER‑3 - Functoriality, α‑reindexing & SquareLaw witnesses.**

EpistemicRetargeting **inherits EFEM functoriality** and specialises it to the retargeting case:

1. At the `Ep` level:
   * `apply(id, X) = X` (no retargeting),
   * `apply(r₂ ∘ r₁, X) = apply(r₂, apply(r₁, X))` whenever domains/codomains match,
   * the composite `r₂∘r₁` has `describedEntityRef(X) = T₁` and `describedEntityRef(cod(r₂∘r₁)) = T₃`, with a composed `KindBridge(T₁,T₃)` whenever the Bridges of `r₁` and `r₂` compose.

2. At the `Ref` level, under `α : Ep → Ref`:
   * each retargeting `r` induces a base arrow `α(r) : R₁→R₂` in `Ref`, compatible with the `KindBridge` used in ER‑0,
   * the square formed by:
     * `X→Y` in `Ep` (retargeting),
     * `α(X)→α(Y)` in `Ref` (base retargeting),
     * any measurement or evaluation morphisms on either side,
       **MUST** commute **up to a declared SquareLaw‑retargeting witness** (Part F / E.TGA), documenting that evaluating then retargeting vs retargeting then evaluating yields equivalent results (modulo CL‑penalties).

2. When retargetings use CorrespondenceModels between epistemes (e.g. aligning detailed hardware layouts with function networks), they MUST:
   * reference the CorrespondenceModel explicitly,
   * publish witness epistemes that certify commutativity of key squares, analogous to EV‑4 but now across **different described entities.**

**ER‑4 - Idempotency & determinism on fixed Bridge/invariant.**

For any `r:X→Y` in `U.EpistemicRetargeting`, with fixed:
* `KindBridge(T₁,T₂)` and ReferencePlane policies,
* invariant `Inv`,
* configuration (ContextSlice, representation families, CorrespondenceModels),

the following MUST hold:

* **Idempotency.**
  Applying `r` twice does not further change the described entity or invariant‑relevant content:
  * `apply(r, apply(r, X))` is **isomorphic** (in the EFEM sense) to `apply(r, X)`,
  * `describedEntityRef` is already `T₂` after the first application,
  * `content` and `referenceScheme` differ at most by declared structural equivalence (e.g. normal forms at the new target).

* **Determinism.**
  For fixed input `X` and fixed Bridge/invariant configuration, the result is uniquely determined modulo declared equivalence. Any source of non‑determinism (randomness, time, external service state) MUST either:
  * be made explicit as part of `content`/`meta` of `X`, or
  * be moved to a `U.Mechanism` outside the retargeting morphism.

**ER‑5 - Applicability, EoI‑pairs & CL‑discipline.**

Each species of `U.EpistemicRetargeting` MUST declare an **Applicability profile** (A.6.0) that includes:

1. **EoI‑pairs.**
   Admissible pairs of `EoIClass`es (ValueKinds of `DescribedEntitySlot` for domain and codomain), for example:
   * `(PhysicalModule, FunctionHolon)`,
   * `(Signal, Spectrum)`,
   * `(Dataset, StatisticalModel)`.

   For each such pair, the pattern MUST reference the appropriate `KindBridge` species in Part F.

2. **Grounding constraints.**
   Permitted classes of `groundingHolonRef` and ReferencePlanes, including whether:
   * grounding must stay within the same holon,
   * or may move along specific holon Bridges with CL^plane penalties.

3. **Viewpoint/context constraints.**
   Whether retargeting is allowed for all viewpoints or only for specific `U.ViewpointBundle`s (TEVB etc.), and any requirements on `BoundedContextRef`.

4. **CL‑discipline.**
   Minimum CL^k and CL^plane required for the Bridges used, aligning with F.9 and E.TGA’s StructuralReinterpretation rules.

Any attempt to apply a retargeting outside this Applicability profile is **ill‑typed**.

**ER‑6 - Compatibility with Viewing and Mechanisms.**

1. **Separation from Viewing.**

   * Any morphism that **does not change** `describedEntityRef` (and keeps `DescribedEntityChangeMode = preserve`) belongs to A.6.3 `U.EpistemicViewing`, not to `U.EpistemicRetargeting`.
   * Any morphism that **does** change `describedEntityRef` **MUST NOT** be declared as `U.EpistemicViewing`; it is either:
     * a `U.EpistemicRetargeting`, or
     * a more general pattern that composes several retargetings and Intension changes.

   In any composite `V∘r` or `r∘V`, describedEntity changes are localised to retargeting steps; Viewing steps are always `describedEntityChangeMode = preserve`.

2. **Separation from Mechanisms.**

   * Retargeting MAY depend on artefacts produced by `U.Mechanism` (e.g., computing a Fourier transform, fitting a model), but those are separate Work/Mechanism steps.
   * `U.EpistemicRetargeting` itself remains **effect‑free**: it rearranges epistemes, slots and ClaimGraphs, but does not perform measurements or actuation.

### A.6.4:5 - Archetypal grounding (Tell–Show–Show)

**Tell.**
EpistemicRetargeting captures **“same invariant, different described entity”** moves:

* we stop talking about “this cabinet” and start talking about “the routing function it realises”;
* we stop talking about “this signal over time” and start talking about “its spectrum over frequency”;
* we stop talking about “this dataset” and start talking about “a model class with parameters θ learned from it”.

In each case, what remains stable is an **invariant** (behaviour, energy, likelihood), not the described entity itself.

**Show 1 — StructuralReinterpretation in E.TGA.** 
* `X` describes a physical module holon `S_phys`.
* `Y` describes a function holon `S_func`.
* A `KindBridge(S_phys, S_func)` expresses “this module realises that function”.
* A StructuralReinterpretation node in E.TGA is an instance of `U.EpistemicRetargeting` whose invariant is the behaviour relation between `S_phys` and `S_func`.

**Show 2 — Signal↔Spectrum.**
* `X` describes a time‑domain signal `s(t)`; `DescribedEntityRef(X) = S_time`.
* `Y` describes its spectrum `S(ω)`; `DescribedEntityRef(Y) = S_freq`.
* `KindBridge(S_time, S_freq)` encodes Fourier duality in the relevant ReferencePlane.
* The invariant is energy (or inner product), expressed as a KD‑CAL statement; EpistemicRetargeting ensures that energy‑related claims in `Y` are entailed by `X`.

**Show 3 — Data→Model.**
* `X` describes a dataset `D` (observations); `DescribedEntityRef(X) = S_data`.
* `Y` describes a model `M` (e.g. a parametric family with learned parameters); `DescribedEntityRef(Y) = S_model`.
* `KindBridge(S_data, S_model)` encodes the intended data→model relation (e.g. MLE, Bayesian posterior).
* The invariant is likelihood or predictive performance; the retargeting laws ensure `Y` does not claim more about this invariant than is supported by `X`.

### A.6.4:6 - Consequences

* **Clear separation of Viewing vs Retargeting.**
  A.6.3 and A.6.4 now jointly distinguish:
  * **views**: same `DescribedEntityRef`, possible representation/viewpoint changes;
  * **retargetings**: different `DescribedEntityRef` under `KindBridge` and invariants.

* **Canonical home for StructuralReinterpretation.**
  E.TGA StructuralReinterpretation becomes a **species of `U.EpistemicRetargeting`**, not an ad‑hoc special node. This reduces duplication and clarifies how CL penalties and Bridges are used.

* **Invariants become first‑class.**
  Retargeting makes invariants explicit and type‑checked: every such morphism must state what it preserves and how that is expressed in KD‑CAL/LOG‑CAL.

* **Safer cross‑plane reasoning.**
  ReferencePlane crossings and kind‑level moves are handled via existing Bridges (Part F), with CL^plane/CL^k penalties and SquareLaw witnesses, instead of hidden in implementation details.

* **Better integration with I/D/S.**
  For `…Description`/`…Spec` epistemes, retargeting is the only place where `DescribedEntityRef` in `DescriptionContext` is allowed to change; all other I/D/S‑level operations (Describe/Specify, Viewing) keep it fixed. 

### A.6.4:7 - Rationale & SoTA‑echoing  *(informative)*
* **Fibrations and base‑change (displayed categories, 2017+).**
  With epistemes forming a category `Ep` fibred over `Ref` via `α : Ep → Ref` (C.2 / A.6.2), EpistemicViewing corresponds to **vertical morphisms** (`α(v) = id`), while EpistemicRetargeting corresponds to **reindexing along base arrows** (`α(r) = b : R₁→R₂`). This lines up with base‑change and transport along fibrations in category theory.

* **Structured cospans and reinterpretation.**
  Modern work on structured cospans and open systems uses cospans and their morphisms to move between different presentations of a system while preserving a notion of interface/behaviour. Retargeting plays a similar role: it moves from one entity kind to another while preserving a declared invariant.

* **Fourier‑style dualities.**
  In signal processing and physics, Fourier and related transforms are often treated as isometries between function spaces, preserving energy while changing the domain of discourse. `U.EpistemicRetargeting` abstracts this pattern: the invariant is codified in KD‑CAL/LOG‑CAL; the morphism explicitly changes the described entity along a `KindBridge`.

* **Data/model duality in ML.**
  Contemporary ML workflows cycle between data and models; invariants such as likelihood, risk, and calibration matter more than raw equality of ClaimGraphs. Retargeting gives a structured way to talk about data→model (and, potentially, model→data) moves as episteme morphisms, rather than untyped “training” steps.

* **Consistency management and abstraction.**
  In model‑driven and bidirectional transformation literature, abstraction and refinement transfers information between models with different subject domains. Treating these as retargetings with explicit Bridges and invariants makes their assumptions amenable to CL accounting and KD‑CAL reasoning, instead of hiding them in tooling.

### A.6.4:8 - Conformance checklist (normative)

**CC‑A.6.4‑1 - EFEM species and DescribedEntityChangeMode.**
Any pattern that claims to define `U.EpistemicRetargeting` **SHALL**:

* declare itself a species of `U.EffectFreeEpistemicMorphing` (A.6.2),
* fix `describedEntityChangeMode = retarget`,
* and state its Applicability profile (EoI‑pairs, contexts, viewpoints, representation schemes, invariants).

**CC‑A.6.4‑2 - Slot‑level read/write discipline.**
For each species of EpistemicRetargeting, authors **MUST**:
* list the SlotKinds it **reads** (at least `DescribedEntitySlot`, `GroundingHolonSlot`, `ClaimGraphSlot`, `ViewpointSlot`, `ReferenceSchemeSlot`, plus any C.2.1+ slots used),
* list the SlotKinds it **writes** (at least `DescribedEntitySlot`, typically also `ClaimGraphSlot`, `ReferenceSchemeSlot`, and `meta`),
* state explicitly how `GroundingHolonSlot` and `ViewpointSlot` behave (preserved vs bridged),
* reference A.6.5 to show that SlotSpecs remain consistent across domain/codomain kinds.

**CC‑A.6.4‑3 - Bridge & invariant declaration.**
Each species SHALL:
* identify the relevant `KindBridge` species (and, where applicable, plane Bridges),
* declare the invariant(s) it preserves (in KD‑CAL/LOG‑CAL terms),
* sketch how invariant preservation is checked or approximated (e.g. through proofs, tests, or statistical guarantees).

**CC‑A.6.4‑4 - SquareLaw‑retargeting witnesses.**
For retargetings that interact with E.TGA or other graph‑level transductions, authors **MUST**:
* describe the commutative squares (or more general diagrams) that express “evaluate then retarget = retarget then evaluate” up to equivalence,
* identify the corresponding SquareLaw‑retargeting witnesses and how they are represented as epistemes.

**CC‑A.6.4‑5 - D/S‑context behaviour.**
For retargetings over `…Description`/`…Spec` epistemes:
* laws MUST be phrased in terms of `DescriptionContext = ⟨DescribedEntityRef, BoundedContextRef, ViewpointRef⟩`,
* `DescribedEntityRef` MUST change in a way consistent with the declared `KindBridge`,
* `BoundedContextRef` MUST either be preserved or changed only via explicit Context‑Bridges,
* `ViewpointRef` MUST either be preserved or change within a declared `U.ViewpointBundle`.

**CC‑A.6.4‑6 - Separation from Viewing and Mechanisms.**
* Any species that leaves `describedEntityRef` unchanged is **not** a conformant EpistemicRetargeting; it belongs to `U.EpistemicViewing` (A.6.3) or another EFEM species.
* Any species that performs measurements, actuation, or other side‑effects MUST be declared as `U.Mechanism`/`U.WorkEnactment` and cannot be an EpistemicRetargeting.

### A.6.4:9 - Mini‑checklist (for authors)

When you think you need “retargeting” in FPF, ask:

1. **Does `describedEntityRef` change?**
   If no, this is Viewing (A.6.3), not Retargeting.

2. **Is there a `KindBridge` between old and new entities?**
   If not, you probably need to introduce one in Part F or rethink the Intension, not fudge a retargeting.

3. **What invariant are you preserving?**
   Write it down in KD‑CAL/LOG‑CAL terms. If you cannot, retargeting is underspecified.

4. **How do `GroundingHolonRef`, context and viewpoint behave?**
   Explicitly state whether they stay the same, move along Bridges, or are out of scope.

5. **Can the operation be factored as Mechanism + pure retargeting?**
   If the step needs computation (FFT, model fitting), separate the Mechanism from the EpistemicRetargeting.

### A.6.4:10 - Relations

* **Specialises / is specialised by.**
  * Specialises A.6.2 `U.EffectFreeEpistemicMorphing` as the `describedEntityChangeMode = retarget` profile.
  * Complements A.6.3 `U.EpistemicViewing` (describedEntity‑preserving EFEM) as the “retargeting” counterpart.

* **Constrained by.**
  * A.6.5 `U.RelationSlotDiscipline` for SlotKind/ValueKind/RefKind discipline.
  * C.2.1 `U.EpistemeSlotGraph` for episteme components and `DescribedEntitySlot`/`GroundingHolonSlot`.
  * E.10.D2 (I/D/S discipline; `DescriptionContext`).
  * Part F (Bridges, `KindBridge`, ReferencePlane crossings, CL/CL^plane).
  * E.10 (LEX‑BUNDLE naming rules, especially on `…Slot`/`…Ref` and ban on Subject/Object in episteme tech names).

* **Consumed by.**
  * E.18 (E.TGA StructuralReinterpretation and other cross‑kind architecture transformations).
  * E.17.0/E.17 (for cases where publication needs to move between different entities‑of‑interest but preserve invariants).
  * KD‑CAL/LOG‑CAL rules that reason about retargeting and invariant preservation across different described entities.
