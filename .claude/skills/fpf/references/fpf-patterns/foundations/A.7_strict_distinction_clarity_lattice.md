## A.7 - Strict Distinction (Clarity Lattice)

### A.7:1 - Intent

Provide a **single, didactically clear lattice of distinctions** that keeps models free from category errors. This pattern is the guard‑rail that prevents four recurrent confusions:

1. **Role vs Function** (mask vs behaviour),
2. **MethodDescription vs Method vs Work** (description vs capability vs occurrence),
3. **Holon vs System vs Episteme** (what can act and what cannot),
4. **Episteme vs Carrier** (knowledge vs its material signs).

It harmonizes A.12 (External Transformer), A.13 (Agential Role & Agency Spectrum), A.14 (Advanced Mereology), and A.15 (Role–Method–Work Alignment).

### A.7:2 - Problem frame

* **Holons (A.1) and systems.** All holons are part/whole units; **only systems** can enact behaviour.
* **Externalization (A.12).** Every change is performed by a **system bearing TransformerRole** across a boundary; there is no “self‑magic”.
* **Quartet backbone (A.3, A.15).** We separate **MethodDescription** (description), **Method** (**capability under a role**), and **Work** (run‑time occurrence), with the **system bearing TransformerRole** as the acting side.
* **Evidence (A.10).** Knowledge claims are anchored via **Symbol‑Carrier Register (SCR)**; epistemes never “act”, they are **used** by systems that act on their **carriers**.

Manager’s reading: if a sentence could be read as “the document decided” or “the process executed itself”, it violates A.7.

### A.7:3 - Problem

When documents blur the above lines, three classes of defects appear:

1. **Category collapse.** People write “function/role/process” interchangeably; teams then disagree whether they are changing a plan, a capability, or reporting an actual occurrence.
2. **Agency misplacement.** Epistemes (documents, models) are treated as doers; collectives as raw sets; or a “holon” is used where **only a system** makes sense.
3. **Audit failures.** A MethodDescription is cited as if it were evidence; or Work has no anchors (no carriers, no time span), making trust impossible (B.3).

### A.7:4 - Forces

| Force                                        | Tension                                                                                                                             |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Didactic brevity vs conceptual precision** | Teams want short words (“process”, “function”) ↔ the framework must keep five distinct layers apart.                                || **Universality vs domain idioms**            | We support engineering idioms (procedure, SOP, algorithm, workflow) ↔ internally we must map them unambiguously.                    |
| **Parsimony vs completeness**                | Minimal concept set ↔ enough distinctions to avoid the classic traps (role/function; plan/capability/occurrence; episteme/carrier). |

### A.7:5 - Solution — The **Clarity Lattice** (normative distinctions & safe vocabulary)

#### A.7:5.1 - **Terminology (normative): orthogonal characteristics**
• **senseFamily** — the categorical characteristic, used by F.7/F.8/F.9: {Role | Status | Measurement | Type‑structure | Method | Execution}. Rows must be **sense‑uniform**. 
• **ReferencePlane** — the referent mode per CHR: {world/external | conceptual | epistemic}. 
• **I/D/S layer** — the Intension/Description/Specification layer (E.10.D2). Not an I/D/S “plane” or "stance", and not a bare "layer".
• **DesignRunTag** — the design vs run DesignRunTag. Not a temporal “plane” or "layer", and not a bare "stance".
• **PublicationSurface** — the *didactic projection* of a Description/Specification into a **bundle of views** (ISO 42010 sense). **Surfaces are not the thing described**. Under L‑SURF, Core allows only **PublicationSurface** and **InteropSurface** tokens; faces SHALL be named **…View / …Card / …Lane** rather than inventing new `…Surface` kinds. The canonical didactic set for architectural patterns in FPF is:
  {**PlainView** (explanatory prose), **TechCard** (typed cards/IDs), **NormsCard** (TechCard profile for checklists/SHALL‑clauses), **AssuranceLane** (evidence bindings/lanes)}. *Surfaces are orthogonal to I/D/S and to design/run.*
• **Typed describing/formalising morphisms (I→D, D→S)** — total morphisms that *project* along I/D/S (they are **not** mechanisms):
  `Describe_ID : I → D` (describe an intensional object into the world of descriptions; historical alias `Publ_ID`) and
  `Specify_DS`/`Formalize_DS : D → S` (refine a description into a specification). Composition `Describe_IS := Specify_DS ∘ Describe_ID : I → S` is allowed but both stages MUST remain visible and auditable.
  **Laws (normative):** (ID‑1) *Non‑extensibility of content*; (ID‑2) *Identity & meaning‑preserving composition*; (DS‑1) *Monotonic refinement* under ≤₍ref₎; (DS‑2) *Pin editions & measurable anchors* per **MM‑CHR** (C.16) via **CHR‑Pins**; (DS‑3) *No retro‑effects*.

A.7 establishes the following **pairs and triplets**. Use their **names** and **scope** exactly as below.

#### A.7:5.2 - Role vs Function (behaviour)

* **Role (role‑object, mask).** A contextual **position** a holon can bear (A.2, A.15). A role is **not behaviour**; it is the **mask** under which behaviour may be enacted. Example: **Cooling‑CirculatorRole** in a thermal loop.
* **Function = behaviour = Method under a role.** What a **system** actually does **when bearing a role**. In Transformer context, this behaviour is the **Method** (design‑time capability) that can be executed as **Work** (run‑time).

  * Safe rewrite for earlier “Holonic Duality (Substance ⧧ Function)”: **Holonic Duality (Substance ⧧ Role).** A `U.System` keeps its identity (substance) while **switching roles**; each role may entail a **Method** (behaviour) and its possible **Work** (occurrence).

**Normative guard:** Use “**Role**” for the mask; use “**Method/Work**” for behaviour/occurrence. Do **not** call the role itself a function.

#### A.7:5.3 - MethodDescription vs Method vs Work (design vs capability vs occurrence)

* **MethodDescription** — the **description** (algorithm / SOP / recipe / script) at design‑time. Anchored via **SCR** (A.10).
* **Method** — the **order‑sensitive capability** the **system bearing TransformerRole** can enact, composed with **Γ\_method** (B.1.5). A Method is a **timeless semantic capability**; **concrete values** are **bound at `U.Work` creation**. Outside executions we **refer to it via MethodDescription** (see A.3.1 CC‑A3.1‑5/‑9; A.15 §2.2, §4.1). 
* **Work** — the **dated run‑time occurrence** (what actually happened), with resource spend (Γ\_work) and temporal coverage (Γ\_time).

**Normative guard:** Never use MethodDescription as evidence of Work; never present Method as if it had happened.

#### A.7:5.4 - Holon vs System vs Episteme (who can act)

* **System** — the only holon kind that can **bear behavioural roles** and enact **Method/Work**.
* **Episteme** — **cannot act**; it is **changed via its carriers** by a system. Epistemes **may bear non‑behavioural roles** (e.g., **ReferenceRole**, **ConstraintSourceRole**).
* **Holon** — umbrella term; **do not** use it where only **system** is meaningful (e.g., “holon bearing TransformerRole” is **invalid**; write “**system bearing TransformerRole**”).

**Normative guard:** Behavioural roles (including TransformerRole) have **domain = system**. Epistemes may bear purely **classificatory** roles only.

#### A.7:5.5 - Episteme vs Symbol Carrier (SCR/RSCR)

* **Episteme** — the knowledge content (claim, model, requirement set).
* **Symbol Carrier** — the physical/digital sign that carries the episteme (file, volume, dataset item), tracked in **SCR**; remote sets in **RSCR**.
* **Use:** Evidence, provenance, and reproducibility address **carriers**; arguments and validity address **epistemes**.

**Normative guard:** When you say “we updated the spec”, detail **which carriers** changed (A.10).

#### A.7:5.6 - Collective vs Set, and MemberOf vs Component/Constituent/Portion/Phase (A.14)

* **Set / Collection (MemberOf)** — **mathematical or catalog** grouping; **no joint behaviour** implied.
* **Collective System** — a **system** with boundary and coordination Method (e.g., a team).
* **Use relations correctly:**

  * **ComponentOf** — mechanical/structural part in systems.
  * **ConstituentOf** — logical/content part in epistemes.
  * **PortionOf** — quantitative portion with conserved extensives.
  * **PhaseOf** — temporal part/state across a continuous identity.
  * **RoleBearerOf** — a **system** is the **bearer** of a **Role**.

**Normative guard:** If the grouping is expected to **act**, model a **collective system** (not a set) and provide its role and Method/Work.

#### A.7:5.7 - Operator alignment (names you MUST use)

* **Γ\_sys** — composition of **system** properties (physical/systemic).
* **Γ\_method** — composition of **Method** (order, branching).
* **Γ\_time** — composition of **Work** histories and temporal parts.
* **Γ\_work** — composition of **resource spend** and yields tied to Work. Do not track costs with Γ\_method; costs (resources/yield) belong to Γ\_work.

**Normative guard:** Avoid generic “process” for these operators. Reserve “process” for domain idioms; map internally to **Method** (design) and **Work** (run).

#### A.7:5.8 - I/D/S vs PublicationSurface (orthogonal, normative)
* **I/D/S governs the model.** What the thing *is* vs how it is *described/tested* lives in I/D/S (E.10.D2).
* **PublicationSurface governs the didactic projection.** How D/S are **presented** lives on **PublicationSurface/InteropSurface** only; concrete faces SHALL be **PlainView / TechCard / InteropCard / AssuranceLane**. Cards/views are **conceptual views over D/S**, not the intensional object **and not symbol carriers**; physical/digital **carriers** stay in **SCR/RSCR** (A.10).
* **Surface field pins.** When D/S are shown on **TechCard**, pin the minimal **CHR‑Pins** = {**UnitType**, **ScaleKind**, **ReferencePlane**, **EditionId**}. 
* **Bridge routing.** Cross‑Context or cross‑plane reuse **MUST** cite **Bridge id + CL**; **Φ(CL)**/**Φ_plane** penalties route to **R (trust)** only; **F/G invariant**. 

#### A.7:5.9 - Typed describing/formalising morphisms (I→D→S, normative)

**What `Describe_ID` / `Specify_DS` mean in A.7.** For any intensional object `X ∈ I`, *describing X* is the morphism application `Describe_ID(X) : D` (historical alias `Publ_ID(X)` in earlier drafts); *formalising that description* is `Specify_DS(Describe_ID(X)) : S` (alias `Formalize_DS`). The collapsed arrow `Describe_IS(X)` MAY be referenced, but **implementations SHALL expose and audit both steps**.

**Invariants (restate of the A.6.2/A.6.3 laws, audit‑oriented):**
1. **Non‑extensibility (ID‑1).** `Describe_ID` MUST NOT introduce new epistemic commitments. If a claim `c` is absent in `X`, it is absent in `Describe_ID(X)`; any added structure is representational only (formatting, indexing, cross‑references).
2. **Identity & meaning preservation (ID‑2).** If `f : X → Y` is a meaning‑preserving map in I, then `Describe_ID(f)` is defined and preserves identity, and where meaningful composition exists, `Describe_ID(f ∘ g) = Describe_ID(f) ∘ Describe_ID(g)`.
3. **Monotonic refinement (DS‑1).** If `D₁ ≤₍ref₎ D₂`, then `Specify_DS(D₁) ≤₍ref₎ Specify_DS(D₂)` (equivalently `Formalize_DS(D₁) ≤₍ref₎ Formalize_DS(D₂)`). Also `D ≤₍ref₎ Specify_DS(D)` holds when S merely adds testable structure.
4. **Pinning of editions & anchors (DS‑2).** `Specify_DS`/`Formalize_DS` MUST pin: **edition id**, **unit/scale types**, **ReferencePlane**, and **measurable anchors** (CG‑Spec/CHR). Pins are visible on **TechCard/NormsCard** faces and recorded in **SCR**; edition governance follows **U.EditionSeries**.
5. **No retro‑effects (DS‑3).** Applying `Specify_DS` yields a *new* `S` and *new* carriers (new SCR ids); earlier carriers remain valid in their scope; **no retro‑mutation** of prior I/D carriers.
6. **Separation from Γ.** `Describe_ID`/`Specify_DS` (`Publ_ID`/`Formalize_DS` in legacy text) do **not** compose with **Γ\_method**, **Γ\_time**, or **Γ\_work**; I/D/S describing/formalising is *not execution* and accrues no resource/time semantics.
7. **Ontology preservation.** Describing any object (Calculus/Signature/Mechanism/…) via `Describe_ID` does **not** change its ontology; it yields a D/S projection by A.7 rules. *Describing/formalising is not a subtype of mechanism*; publishing to surfaces is handled separately in E.17 (MVPK).

### A.7:6 - Archetypal Grounding (Tell–Show–Show; System / Episteme)

#### A.7:6.1 - System and Episteme example
**System archetype — “Digital‑twin vs asset”.**  
*Claim:* *The twin (episteme) does not “act”; the **system** bearing TransformerRole enacts Work on the asset; evidence binds to carriers.*  
*Show:* A maintenance **MethodDescription** (tech card) lives at design‑time; a **Work** record (assurance face) lists Γ_time, Γ_work, PathId and **carrier** ids for telemetry. The twin’s update is **Work on the carrier**, not the asset; CL^plane penalties are disclosed when twin–asset crossings are analysed.

**Episteme archetype — “Peer‑review vs manuscript”.**  
*Claim:* *A review is Work by a **system** (the reviewer) **on carriers** of an episteme (the manuscript).*  
*Show:* The **MethodDescription** is the review SOP; the **Work** cites carrier ids (file/edition) and the *describedEntity* episteme; arguments/rebuttals live on epistemes; acceptance gating lives in CAL, not in CHR cards.

#### A.7:6.2 - Didactic examples

**Example 1 — Pump in a cooling loop**

* **Substance (system):** Centrifugal pump P‑12.
* **Role:** **Cooling‑CirculatorRole**.
* **MethodDescription:** “Loop Circulation v3” (**TechCard**, anchored in SCR).
* **Method:** ordered capability: start → ramp → hold → stop (Γ\_method).
* **Work:** run on 2025‑08‑09 10:00–10:45; energy ledger via Γ\_work; log via Γ\_time.
* **Safe phrasing:** *“The **system** playing **Cooling‑CirculatorRole** (via the P‑12 control unit as **Transformer**) executed the **Method** described by **MethodDescription**, producing **Work** …”*
* **What not to write:** “The pump’s function is the role” (role ≠ behaviour).

**Example 2 — Standard document cited in a design**

* **Episteme:** “Safety Standard S‑174”.
* **Carriers:** PDF (SCR id: scr://std/S‑174/2025‑07), printed volume (scr://print/S‑174/2e).
* **Role:** **ReferenceRole** in the valve selection activity.
* **System bearing TransformerRole:** design team’s selection service.
* **MethodDescription:** “Valve Selection SOP v5”.
* **Method/Work:** capability and dated selection session that **used** the standard; the episteme did **not** act.

**Example 3 — Set vs team**

* **Set (MemberOf):** {Alice, Bob, 3.14} — a collection; **no behaviour** implied.
* **Collective system (team):** boundary, coordination **Method**, supervision **Work**; can bear **AgentialRole** (A.13).
* **Safe phrasing:** *“Team T plays **Cooling‑MaintenanceRole** and executed Work W…”*

Epistemes may bear **non‑behavioural** roles (e.g., ReferenceRole, ConstraintSourceRole) only.                                                                                                                                                         | Role declarations name their domain.                                                                                                      |
| **CC‑A7.13 (I→D→S visibility)**          | I/D/S morphisms MUST be **explicit**; do not conflate them with MVPK or TGA steps. If a flow shows only surfaces, the underlying `Describe_ID`/`Specify_DS` steps MUST be recoverable.       | Both steps are visible in text/diagrams; audit shows two distinct operations.                                                             |
| **CC‑A7.14 (Describe_ID / Specify_DS laws)** | Any implementation of `Describe_ID` MUST enforce **ID‑1/ID‑2**; `Specify_DS`/`Formalize_DS` MUST enforce **DS‑1/‑2/‑3**.

| **CC‑A7.15 (Formalize_DS laws)**         | `Formalize_DS` obeys **DS‑1/DS‑2/DS‑3**: monotonic refinement; pins edition/unit/scale/ReferencePlane/anchors; produces new **S** + **SCR** carriers without retro‑mutation.                                     | Presence of **CHR‑Pins** and pinned anchors; new SCR ids; no edits to prior carriers.                                                     |
| **CC‑A7.16 (Γ‑separation)**              |  Both I/D/S describing/formalising morphisms (`Describe_ID`/`Specify_DS`) and publication‑to‑surface morphisms (MVPK) SHALL NOT carry cost/time semantics; **Γ\_method**, Γ\_time and Γ\_work belong to **Method/Work/System**, not to description/specification or publication. Any aggregate on a card must cite the Γ operator and policy.   | No ledger/time fields attached to `Describe_ID`/`Specify_DS` or MVPK publication steps; any “publication cost” is Work in a separate publication service.             |
| **CC‑A7.17 (**Surface tokens only)**     |  Only **PublicationSurface/InteropSurface** tokens are allowed; faces are **…View/…Card/…Lane**. Use only `PlainView`, `TechCard`, `InteropCard`, `AssuranceLane` (and their tech aliases) unless a DRR extends the set. New `…Surface` kinds require a DRR and L‑SURF revision.                                                 | Token scan shows no ad‑hoc `…Surface` kinds.                                                       |
| **CC‑A7.18 (Bridge+CL on crossings)**    | Any cross‑Context or cross‑plane content on a face **MUST** cite **Bridge id + CL** and **Φ policy‑ids**; penalties route to **R** only.                                                                         | Presence of Bridge ids and **Φ(CL)**/**Φ_plane** on TechCard/AssuranceLane.                        |

### A.7:8 - Canonical rewrites (didactic library)

| Instead of (ambiguous)                           | Write (canonical)                                                                                                                               | Why                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| “The process enforced the rule.”                 | “The **system bearing TransformerRole** enforced the rule by executing the **Method**; the **Work** is anchored to carriers ⟨ids⟩.”             | Processes don’t act; systems do. Evidence via Work + SCR. |
| “The specification decided to tighten limits.”   | “The **design‑control service (system bearing TransformerRole)** updated the **carriers** of the spec (SCR ids), producing **Work** at ⟨time⟩.” | Epistemes are changed via carriers by systems.            |
| “Our role is pump; the role circulates coolant.” | “The **system** plays **Cooling‑CirculatorRole**; under this role its **Method** circulates coolant; **Work** was executed ⟨when⟩.”             | Role = mask; behaviour = Method/Work.                     |
| “We followed the blueprint, so it’s done.”       | “We have a **MethodDescription** and a **Method**; completion is evidenced by **Work** with ⟨timestamps, outcomes⟩.”                                   | Description/capability ≠ occurrence.                      |
| “Team = set of members; it performed repair.”    | “The **team** is a **collective system** (boundary + coordination **Method**); it executed **Work** ⟨…⟩.”                                       | Acting groups must be systems, not sets.                  |
| “Process cost is tracked by Γ\_method.”          | “**Work** cost is tracked by **Γ\_work**; **Γ\_method** composes the **Method** (order/branching).”                                             | Operator alignment.                                       |

| “Publication is a special mechanism.”            | “Publication = **typed projection** from existing Descriptions/Specifications onto **PublicationSurface/InteropSurface** (MVPK); **describing/formalising** are `Describe_ID`/`Specify_DS`, and any execution around them is separate **Work** by a **system** on **carriers**.” | Publication is not behaviour; it is a D/S→Surface projection in the model. |

### A.7:9 - Anti‑patterns (with fixes)

1. **Role‑as‑behaviour** — calling the **role** “the function”.
   **Fix:** Name the **role** + **Method/Work** pair explicitly.

2. **Episteme‑as‑system** — “the model routed traffic”.
   **Fix:** Name the **system** (or Transformer as a system bearing AgentialRole) that used the model; list **carriers** touched.

3. **Triad everywhere** — omitting **Work** entirely.
   **Fix:** Add the Work lane: timestamps, outcomes, Γ\_time coverage.

4. **Operator blur** — using one “process operator” for everything.
   **Fix:** Choose among **Γ\_method**, **Γ\_time**, **Γ\_work**, **Γ\_sys**.

5. **Set‑as‑collective** — a MemberOf set “decides”.
   **Fix:** Model a **collective system** with coordination Method.

6. **Unanchored evidence** — citing ideas without carriers.
   **Fix:** Add **SCR/RSCR** ids; tie claims to carriers.

7. **Holon/system drift** — “holon maintains temperature”.
   **Fix:** Say **system**; reserve “holon” for neutral mereology.

8. **Function/role swap in tables** — columns labelled “Function” but entries are roles.
   **Fix:** Rename column to **Role**; add a separate **Behaviour (Method/Work)** column.

9. **Process‑word leakage** — domain “process” used as FPF operator.
   **Fix:** Add parenthetical mapping at first use (Method/Work).

10. **Carrier/episteme swap** — “we versioned the model” meaning a file was renamed.
   **Fix:** State whether the **episteme content** changed; if only a carrier was renamed, say so.

11. **Publication‑as‑mechanism** — modelling “publication” as if it were a Method/Mechanism.
   **Fix:** Separate **describing/formalising** (`Describe_ID`/`Specify_DS`) from **publication** (MVPK D/S→Surface). If there is operational toil (build, render, upload), model it as **Work** by a **system** on **carriers**; do not change the ontology of the described object or the D/S episteme being surfaced.

### A.7:10 - Consequences

| Benefit                      | Why it matters                                    | Trade‑off / Mitigation                             |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Category safety at scale** | Prevents silent logic bugs across holarchies.     | Slight verbosity → use local shorthand per A.12.   |
| **Trustworthy evidence**     | Work + SCR anchoring makes claims auditable.      | Requires discipline → provide checklists.          |
| **Operator determinism**     | Correct Γ‑flavour selection preserves invariants. | A bit more modelling → reusable templates.         |
| **On‑ramp for managers**     | Canonical rewrites give immediate phrasing fixes. | Team training → this pattern is the training page. |

| Benefits | Trade‑offs / Mitigations |
|---------|---------------------------|
| **Category‑error firewall.** Clear separation of System/Episteme; I/D/S vs Surface orthogonality removes recurring modeling defects. | Authors must tag surfaces explicitly; mitigated by a minimal **SurfacePack** template in E.8. |
| **Audit and pedagogy align.** SCR/RSCR point to carriers; Normative face houses checklists; Plain face teaches; Tech face types. | Slight increase in pattern length; offset by predictable navigation and machine‑checkable CC. |
| **Cross-Context safety.** Bridge+CL discipline is now visible even on surfaces. | Authors must cite CL policy-ids; tooling can assist (GateCrossing visibility harness), but text remains notation-independent. |

### A.7:11 - SoTA‑Echoing (post‑2015 practice alignment)

* **Digital Twins (ISO 23247, 2021→):** separates the asset (system) from its **digital representation** (episteme) and prescribes governance of twins without attributing *agency* to the twin itself — matching A.7’s “episteme ≠ actor” and carrier discipline. **Adopt.** 
* **Observability (OpenTelemetry, 2019→2025):** codifies **semantic conventions** as a *publication layer* over traces/metrics/logs; semantics live in descriptions, not exporters — echoing our **PublicationSurface** orthogonality. **Adapt** (terminology). 
* **Active Inference (2017→2024):** separates a **generative model** (episteme) from **actions** by the agent (system), with explicit perception–action cycles — mirroring A.7’s “who can act” and stance separation. **Adopt** 
* **Constructor Theory (2016→):** frames knowledge and work as **possible transformations** enacted by constructors (systems), not by informational states — reinforcing “episteme ≠ actor”. **Adopt** 
* **Quality‑Diversity (MAP‑Elites family, 2015→2024):** archives are **sets on typed spaces** (descriptions) whose **occurrences** are runs; selection returns **sets** under lawful orders — consonant with A.7 and A.15’s set‑returning discipline. **Adopt/Adapt**. 
* **Refinement‑typed specs (2016→):** modern stacks (e.g., Liquid Haskell, Dafny’s post‑2017 refinements, Rust’s `uom` type‑level units) treat formalization as **monotonic refinement with pinned units/scales** — echoing **Formalize_DS** and **Surface field pins**. **Adapt** (terminology; pinning discipline).

### A.7:12 - Rationale (informal)

* **Engineering cognition:** Large programmes fail less from equations than from category slips (“process vs procedure vs execution”). A.7 eliminates these slips by a small, repeatable grammar.
* **Compatible with ISO/BORO practice:** Distinguishing artefacts (specs), capabilities (procedures), and occurrences (operations) mirrors established systems‑engineering discipline while keeping FPF’s holonic rigor.
* **Didactic primacy:** Managers can approve sentences by spotting five tokens: **system bearing TransformerRole** / **Role** / **Method** / **Work** / **SCR**.
* **Why bring “PublicationSurface” into A.7?** Strict Distinction already guards **what a thing is (I)** from **how we describe/specify it (D/S)**. In practice, **misreadings happen at the publication layer**: cards and tables are mistaken for objects; governance words leak where physics/logic should stand. By making **PublicationSurface** *explicit and orthogonal*, A.7 closes that gap without entangling semantics with any tool or notation. This preserves **C‑1 universality** and **P‑1 Cognitive Elegance**, while giving E.8 a crisp home for multi‑face presentation rules.

### A.7:13 - Relations

 **Builds on:** A.1 (Holon), A.2 (Roles), A.3 (Transformer Quartet), A.10 (Evidence & SCR), A.12 (External Transformer), A.14 (Advanced Mereology), A.15 (Role–Method–Work Alignment).  
* **Constrains:** A.13 (Agency sits on systems only; epistemes non‑behavioural), Part B operators (**Γ_method**/**Γ_time**/**Γ_work**/**Γ_sys**) and their choice points; **publication is not a Γ‑operator**.  
* **Extends:** E.8 (Authoring conventions), E.10 (LEX‑BUNDLE incl. **L‑SURF**), **Part F/G (UTS & CG‑Spec/CHR pinning)**, B.3 (Assurance routing), C‑cluster (selection/archives) — by enforcing I/D/S vs Surface orthogonality, System/Episteme separation, and typed I→D→S describing/formalising discipline (**publication = D/S→Surface in E.17**).  
* **Coordinates with:** **E.18 (E.TGA - GateCrossing / OperationalGate(profile))** for crossing visibility & publication gating, **A.21/A.27** for check/pinning discipline, **E.10** for lexical SD checks, and **Part F (Bridges/CL)** for explicit cross-Context identity — without embedding any notation dependence.
  
### A.7:14 - Manager’s one‑page review (copy‑paste)

**Approval sentence template**

> “The **system bearing TransformerRole** ⟨name⟩ plays ⟨Role⟩; it has **Method** ⟨M⟩ (from **MethodDescription** ⟨S⟩) and executed **Work** ⟨W⟩ on ⟨time⟩, anchored to ⟨SCR ids⟩; resources accounted via **Γ\_work**.”

**Five binary checks**

1. **Actor ban:** No “actor” token; canonical phrasing present.
2. **Clear trio:** MethodDescription / Method / Work are all named (as applicable) and not conflated.
3. **Right Γ:** Γ\_method for capability; Γ\_time for occurrence; Γ\_work for resources; Γ\_sys for system properties.
4. **Episteme handled:** Epistemes do not act; carriers listed (SCR).
5. **Group clarity:** Acting group is a **collective system**, not a MemberOf set.

**Diagram legend stub**

* “process (domain)” ⇒ Method (design‑time) / Work (run‑time).
* Role column lists masks (e.g., Cooling‑CirculatorRole).
* Behaviour column shows Method/Work, not the role itself.
