## A.2.7 - U.RoleAlgebra: In‑Context Role Relations

> **Type:** Definitional (D)
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative

*with `requiredRoles` substitution, SoD (`⊥`), and bundle (`⊗`) hooks*

**Builds on:** A.1.1 **`U.BoundedContext`**, A.2 **Role Taxonomy**.  
**Coordinates with:** A.2.1 **`U.RoleAssignment`**, A.15 **Role–Method–Work Alignment**.

### A.2.7:1 - Problem frame

**Intent.** Provide a tiny, explicit algebra over **role types** inside one Context so engines can (a) substitute specialisations, (b) enforce separation of duties, and (c) treat frequent conjunctions as named bundles—without encoding taxonomy in RoleAssignments.

**Scope.**

* Defines three in‑Context relations/operators: specialization `≤`, incompatibility `⊥`, and bundle `⊗`.
* States substitution semantics used when checking `MethodStep.requiredRoles`.
* States overlap‑prohibition semantics used to validate RoleAssignments.

**Non‑goals.**

* No cross‑Context equivalence by label; cross‑Context reuse is **Bridge‑only** (F.9).
* No mereology; role algebra does not describe part‑of or structure membership.
* No capability model; intrinsic ability evidence lives in `U.Capability` and related patterns.

**Disambiguation.** Do not confuse role specialization `≤` with kind subsumption `⊑` (Kind‑CAL).  
`≤` is **requirement substitution** between role *types* in one Context; `⊑` is **typing** between kinds.

### A.2.7:2 - Solution (the three operators)

Role algebra relates **role types** inside **one** `U.BoundedContext`. It is **not** mereology.

#### A.2.7:2.1 - Specialization (narrower assignment)

* **Notation:** `RoleS ≤ RoleG`
* **Semantics (normative):** For any `U.RoleAssignment` with `role = RoleS` in this Context, the holder **also satisfies** requirements for `RoleG` in this Context.
* **Use:** Stable expertise ladders; privilege inheritance; “junior→senior” substitution.
* **CC‑ALG‑1.** Engines that check `requiredRoles` **MUST** treat `≤` as admissible substitution.

#### A.2.7:2.2 - Incompatibility (conceptual role incompatibility)

* **Notation:** `RoleA ⊥ RoleB`
* **Semantics (normative):** Overlapping `window`s on the same holder for assignments to both roles in this Context are **ill‑formed**.
* **Use:** Separation‑of‑duties (SoD); independence constraints (e.g., performer vs reviewer).
* **CC‑ALG‑2.** Validation **MUST** reject overlapping assignments that violate `⊥`.

#### A.2.7:2.3 - Bundles (conjunctive requirement)

* **Notation:** `RoleC := Role1 ⊗ Role2 ⊗ …`
* **Semantics:** `RoleC` is **satisfied iff** the holder has **simultaneous** valid assignments for each conjunct role (in this Context).
* **Use:** Frequent conjunctions (e.g., “On‑call Incident Commander” = *Engineer ⊗ Communicator ⊗ Decision‑Maker*).
* **CC‑ALG‑3.** Engines that check `requires: [RoleC]` **MUST** expand to conjunctive checks.

+> **Didactic guardrails.**
+> Use `≤` for lasting ladders, `⊥` for critical safety/governance, `⊗` for frequent conjunctions. Prefer listing multiple `requiredRoles` on Method steps to avoid ornate lattices.

+### A.2.7:3 - Relations

**Builds on / depends on**

* **A.1.1 `U.BoundedContext`** — the locality boundary within which the algebra holds.
* **A.2 Role Taxonomy** — role families and context‑local naming.

**Used by**

* **A.2.1 `U.RoleAssignment`** — avoids chained assignments; uses `≤/⊥/⊗` for checking and validation.
* **A.15 Role–Method–Work Alignment** — expands `requiredRoles` and enforces SoD requirements.
* **D.2** ethics/governance patterns — encode SoD and independence via `⊥`.
