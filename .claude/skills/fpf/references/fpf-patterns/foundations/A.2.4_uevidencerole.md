## A.2.4 - `U.EvidenceRole`

> *This pattern defines how a knowledge artefact (“episteme”) serves as **evidence** for a specific claim or theory **inside a bounded context**. It is a **non-behavioural** role enacted via `U.RoleAssignment`; the evidence-role assignment **must** declare the **target claim**, the **claim-scope**, and a **timespan of relevance**. Evidence is a classificatory status of an episteme; it is not an action and it is not an assignment of an actor.*

### A.2.4:1 - Context and intent

FPF separates **what exists** (holons and their kinds) from **what acts** (systems under roles performing work) and from **what is known** (epistemes carried on symbols). Roles are contextual masks that holons may wear; role meanings are **local to a `U.BoundedContext`**. In this setting, we need a kernel‑level way to say that *this* episteme **counts as evidence** about *that* claim, **here**, and **for this period**, without confusing evidence with services, methods, or work. 

**Intent.** Provide one uniform, discipline‑neutral role by which an episteme can be assigned as evidence, while keeping:

* **Agency** on systems performing `U.Work` (not on epistemes).
* **Promise** and Standardual language on `U.ServiceClause` (not on evidence).
* **Recipe** and eligibility on `U.Method` / `U.MethodDescription` (not on evidence).

### A.2.4:2 - Problem

1. **Anthropomorphising epistemes.** Models say “the paper proves…”, implicitly treating a document as an actor.
2. **Citation without scope.** Links exist but lack explicit **target claim**, **applicability scope**, and **time window**.
3. **Deductive versus empirical conflation.** A formal derivation and a lab dataset are both called “support” although their semantics and ageing differ.
4. **Staleness and drift.** Empirical evidence ages; without explicit validity windows, stale evidence keeps influencing conclusions.
5. **Cross‑context leakage.** Evidence is interpreted as “global,” skipping the bridge that is required to move meaning across contexts.

### A.2.4:3 - Forces

| Force                                     | Tension to resolve                                                                                |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Universality versus domain practice**   | One role must cover proofs, datasets, replications, benchmarks, model fits, calibrations.         |
| **Static truth versus ageing confidence** | Axiomatic proofs are stable relative to a theory; empirical evidence decays and requires refresh. |
| **Local meaning versus reuse**            | Meaning is context‑local; reuse must pass through explicit bridges, not tacit “global truth.”     |
| **Clarity versus brevity**                | Kernel must stay expressive without importing domain governance or tooling procedures.            |

### A.2.4:4 - Solution — Term and definition

**Term.**
`U.EvidenceRole` — a **non-behavioural role** that a `U.Episteme` may play **inside a `U.BoundedContext`** to serve as **evidence** for a declared target claim (or theory/version).
The target claim, its applicability scope, polarity, weighting model, and other normative facets are **properties of the `U.EvidenceRole` definition itself** *within that bounded context*.

**How it is enacted.**
The role is enacted by a standard `U.RoleAssignment` that connects:

```
RoleAssigning {
  holder  : U.Episteme,        // the artefact: paper, proof, dataset, report…
  role    : U.EvidenceRole,    // a context-defined role with normative properties
  context : U.BoundedContext   // where the role definition is valid
  timespan?: Interval          // optional: relevance window for this specific assignment
}
```

The **normative properties** of the role (e.g., `claimRef`, `claimScope`, `polarity`, `weightModelRef`) are set in the **role’s definition** in the given `U.BoundedContext`, not in the evidence-role assignment.
`U.RoleAssignment` carries only the linkage between a concrete episteme and a role already defined and attributed in that context.

> **Non-behavioural guard.** The holder is an episteme; any actions that produced it are `U.Work` performed by systems. Evidence classifies an artefact’s evidential status; it does not itself enact behaviour.

**Minimal readable grammar (informative).**
`<Episteme>#<EvidenceRole>:<Context>` — where `<EvidenceRole>` in `<Context>` already normatively specifies `polarity Claim / Scope [weight]`.

**Examples.**

* In `Cardio_2026`, `ModelFitEvidenceRole` is defined with:
  `claim = β-blocker > placebo`, `claimScope = adults 40–65`, `polarity = supports`, `weightModelRef = KD:SupportMeasure`.
  Binding:
  `Trial-R3.csv#ModelFitEvidenceRole:Cardio_2026`.

* In `Theory_T`, `AxiomaticProofRole` is defined with:
  `claim = Theorem-12`, `claimScope = all x ∈ D`, `polarity = supports`.
  Binding:
  `Lemma-12.proof#AxiomaticProofRole:Theory_T`.


### A.2.4:5 - Role family and specialisations

`U.EvidenceRole` is a **role kind** refined by **specialisation** (no mereology of roles). The recommended, substrate‑neutral specialisations are:

**5.1 Axiomatic line (deductive inside a fixed theory)**

* **`AxiomaticProofRole`** — a proof that **entails** a target statement in a declared `U.TheoryVersion`.
* **`CounterexampleRole`** — a witness that **refutes** a universally quantified claim in the theory.
* **`DerivationRole`** — a lemma or intermediary derivation establishing a dependency in the proof spine.
* **`EquiconsistencyEvidenceRole`** — a metaproof establishing equiconsistency or relative strength, often used to **constrain** theory choice.

**Semantics.** In a fixed theory version, these roles are **boolean** and **non‑decaying**. If the axiom base or definitions change, the binding must be re‑issued for the new version; there is no silent carry‑over.

**5.2 Experimental line (empirical, inductive, and model‑selection)**

* **`ObservationEvidenceRole`** — raw or processed observations under a declared method.
* **`MeasurementEvidenceRole`** — calibrated measurements with an error model and traceability.
* **`ModelFitEvidenceRole`** — comparative fit or likelihood of data to competing models; supports one **over** another within the declared scope.
* **`ReplicationEvidenceRole`** — independent replication status (full, partial, failed).
* **`CalibrationEvidenceRole`** — evidence about the measurement chain (instrument validity), typically **constraining** claims.
* **`BenchmarkEvidenceRole`** — standardised tasks or suites producing comparable scores.

**Semantics.** Experimental roles require a **claim‑scope** and a **relevance timespan**. Their contribution to confidence is **graded** and may **decay**; the same artefact may carry multiple bindings for different claims or scopes (distinct role assignments).

> **Specialisation, not stacking.** Do not build chains like “transformer‑agent‑observer role.” A system enacts behavioural roles (e.g., `TransformerRole`) to **perform work**; an episteme enacts `U.EvidenceRole` to **classify** its evidential function. Keep enactment lines separate.

### A.2.4:6 - Clear distinctions (Strict Distinction, litmus tests)

| If you are talking about…               | Use in FPF                                                    | Why                                                                   |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Who acted and consumed resources**    | `U.System` with `U.RoleAssignment` performing `U.Work`           | Only systems act; work records resource deltas.                       |
| **What was promised to a consumer**     | `U.ServiceClause` (promise with access and acceptance)              | A promise is not evidence; it is judged from work.                    |
| **How work should be done or invoked**  | `U.Method` / `U.MethodDescription`                                   | Recipes and interfaces are not evidence.                              |
| **What counts as evidence for a claim** | `U.Episteme` holding `U.EvidenceRole` via `U.RoleAssignment`     | Evidence is a status of an artefact relative to a claim in a context. |
| **Moving meaning across contexts**      | An explicit bridge/alignment pattern in the receiving context | Role meanings are context‑local by design.                            |

### A.2.4:7 - Core invariants (concept level)

1. **Holder type.** `U.EvidenceRole` is held by a **`U.Episteme`** only; never by a system, work, method, or service.  # [M‑0]
2. **Context anchor.** Every evidence-role assignment **must** name a `U.BoundedContext`; meaning is local and does not propagate implicitly.
3. **Target claim.** Every evidence-role assignment **must** reference a resolvable claim or theory statement and declare **polarity** `{supports | refutes | constrains | neutral}`.
4. **Claim-scope.** Every evidence-role assignment **must** declare an applicability scope; for the axiomatic line this can be the theory’s domain.
5. **Timespan.** Every evidence-role assignment **must** declare a relevance interval. Axiomatic roles may be open-ended **for a fixed theory version**; experimental roles require finite or refreshable windows.  **Gating:** narrative only at **M-0**; explicit `timespan` & `decayClass` at **M-2**; version fence & `proofChecks` at **F-**.  # [M/F]
6. **Non-self-evidence.** The provenance of experimental evidence-role assignments **must** trace to external `U.Work` performed by systems under roles; an episteme cannot “evidence itself.”
7. **No mixing of stances.** Do not mix design‑time proof artefacts and run‑time traces in one provenance chain; relate them via separate bindings if needed.
8. **No role mereology.** Roles have **no parts**; refine by **specialisation** only. This prevents confusing “sub‑role” with “subsystem”.   **Profile note:** The constraint is universal (applies to **all profiles**).  # [all]

**Minimal readable grammar (informative).**  
`<Episteme>#<EvidenceRole>:<Context>` — where `<EvidenceRole>` is **defined inside `<Context>`** with normative facets (`claimRef`, `claimScope`, `polarity`, optional `weightModelRef`, decay policy).

**Examples (illustrative only):**

*Cardio (empirical line)*  
Role **definition** in `Cardio_2026`:  
`ModelFitEvidenceRole` with  
`claimRef = (β-blocker > placebo)`, `claimScope = adults 40–65`, `polarity = supports`, `weightModelRef = KD:SupportMeasure`.  
**Binding:**  
`Trial-R3.csv#ModelFitEvidenceRole:Cardio_2026`

*Graph theory (formal line)*  
Role **definition** in `GraphTheory`:  
`AxiomaticProofRole` with `claimRef = Theorem-12`, `claimScope = all finite DAG`, `polarity = supports` (entails), fenced to `TheoryVersion = 3.1`.  
**Binding:**  
`Lemma-12.proof#AxiomaticProofRole:GraphTheory`

### A.2.4:8 - Facets and semantics (normative)

This section deepens the definition of `U.EvidenceRole` by specifying **which normative facets** are attached to its definition within a `U.BoundedContext`, **how decay is handled**, **what provenance anchors are required**, and **how the role contributes to assurance computation**.

#### A.2.4:8.1 - Claim-scope schema

Every `U.EvidenceRole` definition **within a `U.BoundedContext`** **MUST** declare a claim-scope record. This record ties the role’s meaning to the exact target claim and its claim scope, and aligns with the typed-claim form used in B.3:

| Field           | Meaning                            | Norms                                                                                               |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `claimRef`      | Identifier of the supported claim  | MUST resolve within the context’s claim graph; dangling IDs forbidden.                              |
| `claimHost`     | The holon whose claim is supported | MAY be `U.System` or `U.Episteme`.                                                                  |
| `epistemicMode` | `formal` or `postulative`          | MUST be present; governs stability and decay rules.                                                 |
| `assuranceUse`  | `TA` / `VA` / `LA`                 | Declares whether the evidence functions as typing, verification, or validation input (B.3.3).       |
| `applicability` | Domain subset (envelope)           | Optional for formal proofs; REQUIRED for empirical evidence (units, constraints, parameter ranges). |
| `resultKind`    | Kind of content on the carrier     | Examples: theorem/proof obligation; dataset; calibration; model-fit result.                         |
| `notes`         | Additional context                 | Pointers to SCR/RSCR entries; congruence rationale; bridge IDs if imported from another context.    |

#### A.2.4:8.2 - Timespan and decay

Evidence is perishable unless proven otherwise.

* **Formal (axiomatic) roles** MAY have open-ended `timespan.to = null` **only** if fenced to a specific `U.TheoryVersion` and justified in `notes`.
* **Empirical roles** MUST have a finite or refreshable `timespan`. Decay parameters (half-life, renewal window) are set by the context policy and referenced in the role definition.

When the relevance window closes (`validUntil` reached), the evidence incurs **Epistemic Debt (ED)**. Per B.3.4, debt must trigger one of three managed actions:

1. **Refresh** — new work produces fresh evidence for the same claim and scope.
2. **Deprecate** — role is retired; claim support is reduced or removed.
3. **Waive** — explicit steward decision to accept the stale evidence temporarily.

#### A.2.4:8.3 - Provenance hooks

Each `U.EvidenceRole` **MUST** anchor into the **Evidence–Provenance DAG** (A.10):

* **Formal**: `verifiedBy` → proof artefact carrier(s), with optional `checkedBy` metadata for proof-checker runs.
* **Empirical**: `validatedBy` → data carriers from observed `U.Work` runs; `protocolRef` → `U.MethodDescription`; `fromWorkSet` → IDs of those runs.
* SCR/RSCR anchors (A.10) are mandatory for all carriers.

**No self-evidence rule**: the producing `U.Work` must have been performed by a system in an **external** role; an episteme cannot “prove itself” without independent generation.

#### A.2.4:8.4 - Contribution to assurance

A `U.EvidenceRole` classifies an artefact; its contribution to the target claim’s assurance tuple ⟨F, G, R⟩ is computed in B.3 using:

* **F (formality)** — lower-bounded by the least formal constituent in the provenance path.
* **G (ClaimScope)** — limited to the claim scope; unsupported regions are dropped (WLNK).
* **R (reliability)** — computed as:

```
R_eff := max(0, min_path( min_claimR(path) − Φ(CL_min(path)) ))
```

Here:

* `min_claimR(path)` is the smallest justified reliability along the path from the role to the claim in the context’s support graph.
* `CL_min(path)` is the lowest congruence level on that path.
* `Φ` is the penalty function defined by the context policy; it must be monotonic (lower CL → greater penalty).

If any element in the support chain is `postulative`, the aggregate `epistemicMode` is `postulative`.

**TA/VA/LA distinctions**:

* **TA (Typing assurance)** — primary effect is to improve `CL` on edges, reducing penalties in R computation.
* **VA (Verification assurance)** — primarily raises F and the logical component of R.
* **LA (Validation assurance)** — raises empirical R and constrains G to the validated envelope.

### A.2.4:9 - Worked examples

#### A.2.4:9.1 - Formal line — *Proof as evidence for a theorem*

**Role definition (in `GraphTheory`)**  
`AxiomaticProofRole`  
- `claimRef = Theorem-12` (“Every finite acyclic graph admits a topological ordering”),  
- `claimScope = all finite DAG`,  
- `polarity = supports` (entails),  
- `epistemicMode = formal`, `assuranceUse = VA`,  
- fenced to `TheoryVersion = 3.1` (open-ended relevance as long as that version stands).

**Role assignment(s)**  
`Lemma-12.proof#AxiomaticProofRole:GraphTheory`

**Provenance sketch**  
`verifiedBy → Carrier#Proof_p1` (machine-checked), `usedCarrier → Carrier#Def_graph`.

**Effect on assurance (informative)**  
High **F** (machine-checked proof), **G** = “finite DAG”, **R** from proof-obligation integrity; potential CL penalty if an ontology bridge is used.

##### A.2.4:9.2 - Empirical line — *Sensor calibration as evidence for an accuracy claim*

**Role definition (in `Cardio_2026`)**  
`ModelFitEvidenceRole`  
- `claimRef = “Sensor S achieves ±0.3 °C accuracy in [0,70] °C under lab conditions L”`,  
- `claimScope = temperature [0,70] °C; humidity 30–50%; environment L`,  
- `polarity = supports`,  
- `epistemicMode = postulative`, `assuranceUse = LA`,  
- `weightModelRef = KD:SupportMeasure`, `decayPolicy = annual recalibration`.

**Role assignment(s)**  
`Trial-R3.csv#ModelFitEvidenceRole:Cardio_2026`

**Provenance sketch**  
`validatedBy → Carrier#Dataset_calib_v5`, `protocolRef → MethodDescription#ThermoCalibration`, `fromWorkSet → {cal_run_0502, cal_run_0503}`.

**Effect on assurance (informative)**  
**F** from formalised procedure, **G** = measured envelope, **R** from replication and CL on unit mapping; **R** decays after the policy window unless refreshed.

### A.2.4:10 - Conformance checklist (normative)

**CC-ER-01 (Type & holder)**
`U.EvidenceRole` **MUST** be held by a `U.Episteme` via `U.RoleAssignment`. Systems, services, methods, or works **MUST NOT** hold this role.

**CC-ER-02 (Context)**
Every evidence-role assignment **MUST** name a `U.BoundedContext`. Role meanings are local and do not propagate without an explicit bridge.

**CC-ER-03 (Target claim)**
Every evidence-role assignment **MUST** reference a resolvable `claimRef@version` and declare `polarity ∈ {supports | refutes | constrains | neutral}`.

**CC-ER-04 (Claim-scope)**
Every evidence-role assignment **MUST** declare `claimScope`. For formal proofs this may be the theory’s domain; for empirical evidence it is mandatory to state population, environment, and parameter envelope.

**CC-ER-05 (Timespan)**
Every evidence-role assignment **MUST** carry a non-empty `timespan`. Formal line may have open-end **only** if fenced to a fixed theory version; empirical line must have a finite or refreshable end.

**CC-ER-06 (Provenance)**
Every evidence-role assignment **MUST** anchor into the EPV-DAG (A.10). For empirical line, `fromWorkSet` must point to external `U.Work`; self-evidence is prohibited.

**CC-ER-07 (Reproducibility)**
Empirical evidence-role assignments **MUST** state `reproducibility` ∈ {replicated-independent, replicated-internal, not-replicated, irreproducible}, with references where applicable.

**CC-ER-08 (Weight discipline)**
If `weight.score` is present, `weight.modelRef` **MUST** be named and all required inputs supplied.

**CC-ER-09 (Cross-context)**
Cross-context reuse **MUST** go via `U.Alignment` bridge; record `CL_min` on the path for assurance penalties.

**CC-ER-10 (Version fences)**
If the claim or episteme versions, create a new binding; do not mutate in place.

**CC-ER-11 (No role-of-role)**
Roles never hold roles; there is no chaining of behavioural sub-roles into non-behavioural ones.

**CC-ER-12 (Terminology)**
Use *specialisation* for role refinements; reserve *sub* for mereology of systems or artefacts only.

**CC-ER-13 (Lane declaration)**
Every binding **SHALL** declare `assuranceUse ∈ {TA | VA | LA}` and, for **empirical** (LA) bindings, expose `timespan/valid_until` and `decayPolicy` so that SCR can report lane‑separated contributions and freshness (B.3).

### A.2.4:11 - Anti-patterns and remedies

| Anti-pattern                | Symptom                                                | Remedy                                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data speaks for itself**  | Binding with no `context` or `claimRef`.               | Anchor to context and explicit claim; set polarity and timespan.        |
| **Evidence = the work run** | Treating `U.Work` as the episteme.                     | Keep factual record on `U.Work`; create a report episteme to bind.      |
| **Attach to system**        | Holder is `U.System`.                                  | Holder must be an episteme; system may be `claimHost`, not role holder. |
| **Global evidence**         | Using one binding across contexts with no bridge.      | Create explicit `U.Alignment` bridge; declare loss policy.              |
| **Ad-hoc weight**           | Number assigned with no declared model.                | Use context-declared model; supply required inputs.                     |
| **Service proves itself**   | Service KPI logged as evidence.                        | KPIs come from `U.Work`; service evaluation can be bound as evidence.   |
| **Scope blur**              | Mixing design-time and run-time provenance in one EPV. | Split into separate bindings; relate via claim graph or bridge.         |


### A.2.4:12 - Operators (conceptual, tooling-agnostic)

These operators extend E.6.1 citation graph capabilities for evidence analysis inside a `U.BoundedContext`:

**12.1 Per-claim evidence**
`evidenceFor(claim, t?) → Set[EvidenceRoleAssigning]`
`counterEvidenceFor(claim, t?) → Set[EvidenceRoleAssigning]`
`weight(claim, t?, model?) → score`   # returns **ordinal** at M‑mode; **numeric** at M‑2/F‑mode.  # [M/F]

**12.2 Decay and windows**
`window(claim, [t0,t1])` — filter evidence-role assignments by `timespan`.
`decayedWeight(assignment, t)` — apply context decay policy.

**12.3 Replication and provenance**
`replicationLedger(binding) → Ledger`
`isIndependentReplication(binding) → boolean`

**12.4 Formal line hooks**
`proofChecks(binding) → {assistant, status, hash, kind∈{classical, constructive}}`  # [F‑\*]
`dependsOnAxioms(binding) → Set[AxiomId]`

**12.5 Empirical line hooks**
`fromWorkSet(binding) → Set[WorkId]`
`protocol(binding) → MethodDescriptionId`

### A.2.4:13 - Relations

**Builds on:**
A.2 `U.Role`, A.2.1 `U.RoleAssignment` (role as mask, binding as assignment), A.10 Evidence Graph Referring (EPV-DAG), B.3 Trust & Assurance Calculus.

**Coordinates with:**
A.3.2 `U.MethodDescription` (protocols, proof obligations), E.6.1 Epistemic Roles via `U.RoleAssignment` (didactic gateway).

**Informs:**
KD-CAL (knowledge dynamics, assurance cases), Norm-CAL (policy claims with evidence), planned `U.ServiceClauseEvaluation` (services judged from work and reported as epistemes with evidence bindings).


### A.2.4:14 - Migration notes (quick wins)

1. **Enumerate claims**: For each evidence collection, identify claims and create explicit bindings with polarity.
2. **Separate work from reports**: Facts stay on `U.Work`; create report epistemes to link as evidence.
3. **Name the calculus**: Replace free-form confidence with context-declared weight model and required inputs.
4. **Fence by version/time**: Bindings carry `timespan` and version fences; add decay class if applicable.
5. **Bridge explicitly**: Cross-context evidence goes through `U.Alignment`, not by fiat.

### A.2.4:15 - Didactic quick cards (engineer-manager ready)

These are short reminders for non-specialist readers to apply `U.EvidenceRole` correctly:

* **Evidence ≠ Work** — Work is *what happened*; Evidence is a *documented argument* (episteme) about a claim in a context.
* **Local, not global** — Evidence links *in a room* (context). Outside that room, you need a bridge (`U.Alignment`).
* **Two lines of trust** — Formal line: proof artefacts checked in a declared theory version. Empirical line: observations from Work under a declared method. Both are epistemes wearing `U.EvidenceRole`.
* **Services are promises; Work proves** — KPIs are measured from Work; service evaluations can be bound as evidence for policy claims.
* **Specialise, don’t stack** — Use specialisations of `U.EvidenceRole` to refine meaning; never chain behavioural roles into evidence.


### A.2.4:16 - SCR/RSCR audit stubs (assurance scaffolding)

These stubs allow concept-level validation of evidence-role assignments, without implying any specific tooling.

**SCR-A2.4-E1 (Assignment integrity)**
Assert: `holder` is `U.Episteme`; `context` present; `claimRef` resolves; `timespan` non-empty; provenance anchored to EPV.

**SCR-A2.4-E2 (Weight discipline)**
Assert: if `weight.score` present → `weight.modelRef` present and all required inputs provided; recompute to check.

**SCR-A2.4-E3 (Traceability)**
For empirical evidence-role assignments: assignment → `fromWorkSet` → each `U.Work` has performer `U.RoleAssignment` and timestamps; no missing hops.

**RSCR-A2.4-R1 (Regression on version bump)**
When `claimRef` or holder episteme versions change, ensure **new** bindings are created; no in-place mutation.

**RSCR-A2.4-R2 (Decay check)**
Bindings past `timespan.to` or with expired `decayClass` are flagged for review per context policy.

### A.2.4:18 - Memory hooks and acceptance cross-checks (informative)

**Memory hook:** *“Evidence links a **document** to a **claim** in a **Context**, for a **time**, with a **trail**.”*
(document = episteme; claim = scoped thesis; Context = bounded context; time = timespan/decay; trail = provenance)

**Acceptance cross-checks before publishing a binding:**

1. **Holder**: Is it a `U.Episteme`?
2. **Context**: Is the `U.BoundedContext` declared?
3. **Claim**: Does `claimRef` resolve? Is `polarity` set?
4. **Scope**: Is `claimScope` complete? For empirical, are population/env/parameters given?
5. **Timespan**: Is it finite or fenced (formal line)?
6. **Provenance**: Is EPV anchored? Any self-evidence?
7. **Reproducibility**: For empirical, is it declared?
8. **Weight**: If scored, is the model named and inputs complete?
9. **Cross-context**: If imported, is `U.Alignment` bridge in place with CL\_min recorded?
10. **No role-of-role**: Is this role bound directly to an episteme without chaining behavioural roles?
