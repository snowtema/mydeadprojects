## A.2.5 - U.RoleStateGraph: The Named State Space of a Role

### A.2.5:1 - Purpose & scope (why this exists)

A **role** is not only a name; it is a *trajectory of admissible states* that governs when, and under which conditions, a holder of that role may **enact** steps of a `U.MethodDescription`. FPF therefore introduces a first‑class intensional object:

> **`U.RoleStateGraph` (RSG)** — the **finite, named state space** of a **`U.Role` in a given `U.BoundedContext`**, with transitions guarded by conditions over the **Role Characterisation Space (RCS)** and contextual events.

The RSG is the **gate** between *assignment* (`U.RoleAssignment`) and *action* (`U.Work`). A step may be performed **only** when the performer’s assignment is **in an enactable RSG state** at the relevant **Window** (time slice) and this is **proven** by a contemporaneous **StateAssertion** (verdict of `U.Evaluation` against the state’s **Checklist**).


### A.2.5:2 - Problem frame (what goes wrong without an RSG)

1. **Readiness blur.** Teams conflate “has the badge” with “is fit to act now”. Without explicit states (*Ready*, *Calibrated*, *Authorized*, *Suspended*…), enactment checks dissolve into ad‑hoc judgement.
2. **Checklist drift.** Criteria for “ready/approved” live in scattered documents; there is no single conceptual anchor tying them to the role.
3. **Workflow/role confusion.** “State” of a *workflow* (according to workplan) is mistaken for the *state of a role* (eligibility to enact).
4. **Status ≠ enactment.** Epistemic/Normative roles (e.g., *NormativeStandard*, *ApprovedSpecification*) need *statuses* that are **not enactable**, yet are used to gate decisions.
5. **Cross‑context substitution by name.** Labels like *Approved* or *Ready* silently cross contexts with different criteria; the loss is hidden and unaudited.

**Consequences.** Violations of **Strict Distinction (A.7)** and **Didactic Primacy (E.12)**: ambiguous authority to act, unsafe SoD, and non‑reproducible evaluations.


### A.2.5:3 - Core idea (didactic)

Think of a **Role** as a **mask**, and the **RSG** as the **traffic lights for that mask** inside one context of meaning.

* The **nodes** are **named states** (*Ready*, *Degraded*, *Suspended*, *Approved*, *Obsolete*…).
* The **edges** are **transitions** with **guards** (checkable conditions over RCS characteristics and contextual events, e.g., *CalibrationAge ≤ 30d*; *AuthorizationSpeechAct recorded*).
* Each **state** is paired with a **Checklist** (criteria you test to issue a **StateAssertion** for a given **Window**).
* Some states are **enactable = true** (green lights); others are **not enactable** (status lights) and therefore can **gate decisions** but **cannot** directly authorize `U.Work`.

> **One sentence.** **RSG says *when a badge is green*.** The Checklist proves it, the **StateAssertion** records it, and the Method step may proceed.


### A.2.5:4 - Minimal vocabulary (this pattern only)

* **`U.RoleStateGraph` (RSG).** Intensional object *owned by* `(Role, Context)`. Finite set of named **States** and typed **Transitions** with guards.
* **RSG.State.** Intensional **named place**. Properties:

  * `enactable ∈ {true,false}` — whether being in this state authorizes enactment of steps that require this role.
  * `initial?`, `terminal?` — optional markers for lifecycle reasoning.
* **RSG.Transition.** Edge `state_i → state_j` with **Guard** (predicate over RCS characteristics and/or contextual events such as `U.SpeechAct`, `U.Observation`, `U.Evaluation` results).
* **RCS (Role Characterisation Space).** The **characteristic bundle** that characterises this role in this Context (e.g., *CalibrationAge*, *AuthorizationScope*, *FatigueIndex*, *IndependenceFlag*, *EvidenceFreshness*). *(Defined in A.2 Role Taxonomy / RoleDescription.)*
* **State Checklist (description).** A **RoleDescription** component that enumerates **criteria** to test whether a holder can legitimately be treated as **in** a given state for a **Window**. *(Description, not the state itself.)*
* **`U.Evaluation` → StateAssertion (verdict).** The **result** of applying the state’s Checklist to a **concrete holder** at a **time window**, yielding a **verdict** “IN‑STATE(S) @Window” with provenance to observations/evidence.
* **Window.** Temporal interval to which the StateAssertion applies (e.g., `[2025‑05‑01, 2025‑06‑01]`).

> **Strict distinction note.**
>
> * **RSG** and its **States** are **intensionals** (what the role *is allowed to be*).
> * **Checklists** and **StateAssertions** are **descriptions/evaluations** (how we *know* a specific holder *is* in that state now).


### A.2.5:5 - What an RSG is **not** (guardrails)

* **Not a workflow.** RSG transitions do **not** encode task order; they encode **eligibility changes** of the *role*.
* **Not a capability list.** RSG is **authorization/readiness over time**, distinct from `U.Capability` (ability).
* **Not a global status set.** RSG lives **inside one Context**; the label *Ready* in another Context is **a different state** unless bridged (F.9).
* **Not a log.** RSG is not a history. Histories are **StateAssertions** over Windows; **`U.Work`** is the record of enactments.
* **Not a document lifecycle.** Epistemic role RSGs can *look like* document lifecycles, but they remain **role‑status graphs**; the **carrier** lifecycle stays separate (A.7, `U.Carrier`).


### A.2.5:6 - Invariants (preview)

1. **Locality.** `RSG(Role, Context)` is defined **only** within that `U.BoundedContext`.
2. **Finiteness.** The **State** set is finite and named.
3. **Checklist pairing.** Every State has a **Checklist** in the Role’s **RoleDescription**; every enactable State has **at least one** observable criterion.
4. **Green‑gate discipline.** A Method step requiring `Role` may proceed **only** if a contemporaneous **StateAssertion** exists for an **enactable** State.
5. **No silent Cross‑context reuse.** Cross‑Context reuse requires a **Bridge** with CL and loss notes; local `⊥/≤/⊗` always prevail.

### A.2.5:7 - Formal structure of an RSG (intensional, context‑local)

> **Definition.** For a given **`U.Role`** in a given **`U.BoundedContext`**, its **`U.RoleStateGraph`** is the tuple
> `RSG(Role, Context) = ⟨S, S_en, T, Guard, init?⟩`, where:

* **`S`** — a **finite set of named States** (`StateName ∈ Tech register`, with a Plain label). Names are **local to `(Role, Context)`**.
* **`S_en ⊆ S`** — the subset of **enactable** states (“green lights”). States in `S \ S_en` are **status‑only** (not enactable).
* **`T ⊆ S × S`** — a set of **typed transitions** `sᵢ → sⱼ`. Transitions are optional; the RSG may be acyclic or cyclic.
* **`Guard`** — for each transition (and optionally for state maintenance), a **predicate over**:

  * the role’s **RCS snapshot** at a **Window** (values on named characteristics; see A.2.3), and
  * **Context events** (e.g., presence of a `U.SpeechAct`, freshness of `U.Observation`, validity of a prior `U.Evaluation`).
* **`init? : S → {true,false}`** — optionally marks **initial** state(s). (Useful for lifecycles; not required for gating.)

**Naming discipline (RSG‑N1…N3).**

1. **RSG‑N1 (Minimal set).** `|S| ≥ 1`. At least **one** state must exist; if **no** state is enactable, the role is **status‑only** in this Context.
2. **RSG‑N2 (Disjoint labels).** State names are **unique** within `(Role, Context)`; reusing global labels (e.g., “Ready”) across contexts is allowed **only** via Bridges (F.9).
3. **RSG‑N3 (Human scale).** For didactics, **≤ 7 states** is the default target; exceeding it requires a one‑sentence rationale (“distinct gate we will actually use”).


### A.2.5:8 - Enactability & Checklist semantics (how a state is *known*, now)

An RSG **does not** determine history; it determines **what counts as being in a state**, and which states **authorize enactment**.

#### A.2.5:8.1 - State Checklists (description, not the state)

For each `s ∈ S`, the **RoleDescription** (A.2.3) includes a **State Checklist** `Checklist(s)` — a **named set of criteria** that can be evaluated at a **Window** to test “**holder is in state `s`**”.

* **Criterion kinds (illustrative):**

  * **Threshold over RCS characteristic:** `CalibrationAge ≤ 30 days`.
  * **Presence of act:** `AuthorizationSpeechAct exists within 90 days`.
  * **Evidence freshness:** `Evidence(type=SafetyTest).age ≤ 12 months`.
  * **SoD flag:** `IndependenceFlag = true`.
  * **External status:** `StandardStatus = Approved`.

> **Strict distinction.** `Checklist(s)` is a **description**; the **state** `s` is an **intensional place** in the role’s RSG.

#### A.2.5:8.2 - From Checklist to **StateAssertion** (verdict of `U.Evaluation`)

Evaluating `Checklist(s)` at a **Window** produces an **`U.Evaluation` verdict**:

> **`StateAssertion(holder, Role, Context, s, Window)`** — “*For this Window, this holder **is** in state `s`*”, with provenance to the actual observations/evidence.

**Rules (RSG‑C1…C5).**

* **RSG‑C1 (All‑must‑hold).** A `StateAssertion` **MUST** justify that **all required criteria** in `Checklist(s)` hold at the Window.
* **RSG‑C2 (Window freshness).** Each criterion **MUST** define its freshness window; if omitted, default is **instantaneous** at the Window’s end time.
* **RSG‑C3 (No guess).** Pure opinion is disallowed; every criterion is grounded in **observable facts** (`U.Observation`, `U.Work` record, `U.SpeechAct`, or a derived `U.Evaluation`).
* **RSG‑C4 (Non‑monotonic over time).** A `StateAssertion` is **not** permanent; once the Window ends, a new evaluation is needed unless a **maintenance guard** keeps it valid (see 8.3).
* **RSG‑C5 (Uniqueness not required).** Multiple states may be asserted for the same Window if their criteria do not conflict (e.g., `Ready` and `Authorized`). **Enactability** is governed by §8.4.

#### A.2.5:8.3 - Transitions & guards (admission, maintenance, exit)

RSG transitions **express how eligibility changes** when guards fire. Guards are **predicates**; the RSG stays **notation‑neutral**.

* **Admission guard (`→ s`)** declares **conditions to enter** state `s`.
* **Maintenance guard (`s ↺`)** must hold to **remain** in `s` (e.g., *FatigueIndex < 0.8*, checked every shift).
* **Exit guard (`s →`)** declares **conditions to leave** `s` (e.g., *CalibrationAge > 30d*).

**Rules (RSG‑G1…G3).**

* **RSG‑G1 (Checklists vs guards).** Checklists decide **recognition** (“am I in `s` now?”). Guards describe **change** (“what moves me in/out of `s`?”). They may reuse the **same predicates**; their roles are distinct.
* **RSG‑G2 (No control‑flow).** Guards may refer to **events** (e.g., “Calibration completed”), but RSG is **not a task graph**; it does not prescribe task order.
* **RSG‑G3 (Observable basis).** Every guard references **observable** RCS characteristics or recorded events (no hidden timers).

#### A.2.5:8.4 - The **Green‑Gate Law** (enactment gating)

> **Law (RSG‑E1).** A `U.MethodDescription` step that **requires** role `R` **may be enacted** at Window `W` **iff** there exists a `StateAssertion(holder, R, Context, s, W)` with `s ∈ S_en`.

Corollaries:

* **RSG‑E2 (Specialization lift).** If the step requires a **general role** `R`, and the holder has a `StateAssertion` for a **specialist role** `R' ≤ R` in an **enactable** state whose **lift** (see §9.1) is enactable for `R`, the gate passes.
* **RSG‑E3 (Bundle gate).** If the step requires a **bundle** `R* = R₁ ⊗ … ⊗ Rₙ`, enactment requires **n distinct `StateAssertions`** meeting RSG‑E1 for each `Rᵢ` (unless the Context defines a **CompositeRole** with its own RSG; see §9.3).
* **RSG‑E4 (Status‑only roles).** Roles with `S_en = ∅` can **never** authorize enactment; they may **gate decisions** (e.g., *ApprovedSpecRole*) but not `U.Work`.


### A.2.5:9 - Interaction with role algebra (`≤`, `⊥`, `⊗`) and refinement

#### A.2.5:9.1 - Specialization (`≤`) — RSG refinement map

When **`R' ≤ R`** (Specialist role refines General role) **in the same Context**, their RSGs **must align** by a **refinement map**.

> **Rule (RSG‑R1 Refinement).** There exists a **surjective mapping**
> `π : S(R') → S(R)` such that:
>
> 1. **Enactability preservation:** `s' ∈ S_en(R') ⇒ π(s') ∈ S_en(R)`.
> 2. **Checklist entailment:** `Checklist_R'(s') ⇒ Checklist_R(π(s'))` (each specialist state’s criteria **imply** the general state’s criteria).
> 3. **Guard monotonicity (informal):** Transitions in `R'` **do not weaken** the general readiness implied by `R` (entering/exiting patterns respect π).

**Interpretation.** Being in `s'` for `R'` *guarantees* being in `π(s')` for `R`. Thus **StateAssertions lift** along π, enabling **RSG‑E2**.

**Design note.** RCS for `R'` may **extend** that of `R`; specialist states can be **stricter** (more criteria) but not **looser** than their general counterparts.

#### A.2.5:9.2 - Incompatibility (`⊥`) — state‑aware SoD

`R_A ⊥ R_B` (within the same Context) states that **a single holder** **must not** have **overlapping, enactable authority** for both roles.

> **Rule (RSG‑I1).** At **Window `W`**, a holder **violates** `R_A ⊥ R_B` iff there exist **StateAssertions**
> `… in s_A ∈ S_en(R_A)` **and** `… in s_B ∈ S_en(R_B)` **both valid at `W`**.

**Optional refinement (soft ⊥).** Contexts **may** tighten incompatibility by listing **state pairs** that are forbidden (e.g., `Ready_A ⊥ Authorized_B`), while allowing benign combinations (e.g., `Suspended_A` + `Ready_B`). By default, **any** enactable pair conflicts.

**Didactic payoff.** SoD is checked by **states in Windows**, not by static role labels.

#### A.2.5:9.3 - Bundles (`⊗`) — conjunction without product explosion

A **bundle role** `R* := R₁ ⊗ … ⊗ Rₙ` expresses “**must wear all these badges at once**”.

> **Rule (RSG‑B1).** If `R*` exists **only as a requirement macro**, **do not** construct a product RSG. The **gate** for a step requiring `R*` is satisfied by **n separate StateAssertions** `sᵢ ∈ S_en(Rᵢ)` at the same Window.

> **Rule (RSG‑B2 CompositeRole).** If the Context **declares `R*` as a first‑class `U.Role`**, it **MUST** also specify an `RSG(R*)` and an embedding `ιᵢ : S(R*) → S(Rᵢ)` that **preserves enactability**; being in an enactable state of `R*` **implies** being enactable in each `Rᵢ`.

**Rationale.** Avoid combinatorial blow‑up by default; allow a composite role **only** when the organization genuinely maintains its **own** readiness graph.

#### A.2.5:9.4 - Readiness monotonicity across specialization & bundles

* **RSG‑M1 (Specialist suffices).** If a step requires `R`, any `R' ≤ R` whose **lifted state** is enactable **suffices**.
* **RSG‑M2 (Bundle conjunctivity).** If a step requires `R₁ ⊗ R₂`, the performer must produce **both** gates (two StateAssertions), unless a CompositeRole with RSG exists and is used.


### A.2.5:10 - Guard design (types and discipline)

To keep RSGs **operational** but **not procedural**, guards draw on **observable** inputs only.

**Guard types (non‑exhaustive).**

1. **Threshold guards** over RCS characteristics
   `FatigueIndex < 0.8`, `CalibrationAge ≤ 30d`, `EvidenceFreshness(role=Tester) ≤ 90d`.
2. **Event guards** (occurrence since last Window)
   `exists SpeechAct(type=Authorization)`, `exists Evaluation(verdict=Pass, checklist=SafetyKit)`.
3. **Temporal guards** (time within range)
   `now ∈ AuthorizationValidityWindow`, `MaintenanceWindow not active`.
4. **Relational guards**
   `IndependenceFrom(holder=X) = true` (for SoD), `NoOpenIncident(severity≥High)`.

**Rules (RSG‑G4…G6).**

* **RSG‑G4 (Observable only).** Each guard **MUST** be checkable from **observable artefacts** (observations, work logs, speech acts, evaluations) or present RCS values.
* **RSG‑G5 (Context‑local semantics).** Guard semantics are **scoped to Context**; Cross‑context reuse requires a Bridge (§14 in Part 1/4, F.9).
* **RSG‑G6 (Didactic sparseness).** Prefer **few, stable guards** over many brittle micro‑conditions. If a guard encodes **task order**, you are drifting into workflow; refactor back to eligibility.

Allowed guard evidences include:
* Observation facts (measurements/metrics),
* Evaluation verdicts (checklist results),
* SpeechAct occurrences (communicative `U.Work`), identified by role, act kind, and window (e.g., “Approved(change=4711)”).

A SpeechAct can change the state (e.g., Prepared→Authorized) but does not by itself satisfy operational steps; it only opens their Green‑Gate.

### A.2.5:11 - Putting it together (one‑screen mental model)

At any **Window**:

1. **RoleAssignment exists** (A.2.1): `Holder#Role:Context`.
2. **StateAssertion(s) exist**: the holder is **in** one or more **states** as proven by checklists (`U.Evaluation`).
3. **Green‑Gate Law** applies: if at least one asserted state is **enactable**, role‑gated **Method steps** may be enacted; if all are **status‑only**, the role can **gate decisions** but **not** perform work.
4. **Role algebra** checks: specialization lifts readiness; bundles require **conjunction**; incompatibilities are detected when **two enactable states** coincide for the same holder at the same Window.

This yields a **clean separation**:

* **assignment** (RoleAssignment)
* **Readiness** (RSG + Checklists + StateAssertions)
* **Action** (`U.Work`, gated by RSG)

…and keeps meaning **local**, evidence **observable**, and reasoning **testable**.

### A.2.5:12 - Archetypal RoleStateGraphs (cross‑domain patterns)

Below are **didactic, reusable** RSG skeletons for the three principal **behavioural** role families and for **epistemic/status** roles. Names and criteria are **context‑local**; treat them as **templates** to specialise inside your `U.BoundedContext` (E.10.D1). For each RSG we list:

* **`S`** — candidate **States** (enactable states marked **\[E]**);
* **Checklist gist** — the **recognition** criteria (cf. §8.1);
* **Guards** — illustrative **admission/maintenance/exit** predicates (cf. §8.3).

> **Reminder.** Only **enactable** states (**`S_en`**) can open the **Green‑Gate** for `U.Work` (RSG‑E1). Status‑only states **gate decisions** but never execution.

#### A.2.5:12.1 - AgentialRole (decision‑capable actor)

**Context sketch:** `Ops_ChangeManagement_2025`.
**RCS (characteristics, examples):** *CompetenceLevel, FatigueIndex, IndependenceFlag, AuthorizationValidity, IncidentLoad, RiskClass.*

**States `S`**

* **Unprepared** — training incomplete; checklists fail.
* **Prepared** — training + competence thresholds met.
* **Authorized** — valid approval window present. **\[E]**
* **Ready** — `Prepared ∧ Authorized ∧ FatigueIndex < τ`. **\[E]**
* **Active** — contemporaneous **`U.Work`** step is underway under this role (**with a valid StateAssertion in the window**). **\[E]**
* **Suspended** — temporary block (incident/conflict).
* **Revoked** — authorization expired/withdrawn.

**Checklist gist**

* *Prepared*: certificates valid; recency of practice ≤ X; simulator score ≥ Y.
* *Authorized*: `exists SpeechAct(type=Approval, scope=Role, age≤30d)`.
* *Ready*: *Prepared ∧ Authorized ∧* independence from conflicting work; fatigue within limits.

**Guards**

* Admission `→ Prepared`: `ExamPassed ∧ SimulatorScore≥Y`.
* Admission `→ Authorized`: presence of approval speech‑act within window.
* Maintenance `Ready ↺`: `FatigueIndex<τ ∧ IncidentLoad≤k`.
* Exit `Ready → Suspended`: high‑severity incident assigned OR SoD violation detected.
* Exit `Authorized → Revoked`: window elapsed or explicit revoke speech‑act.

#### A.2.5:12.2 - TransformerRole (non‑agential executor of change)

**Context sketch:** `PlantOps_Pipeline_2025`.
**RCS:** *CalibrationAge, SafetyInterlock, SelfTestPass, EnvRangeOK, DegradationIndex.*

**States `S`**

* **Unavailable** — offline, missing prerequisites.
* **Calibrated** — calibration fresh; self‑test ok.
* **Permitted** — safety interlocks clear; clearance token valid.
* **Ready** — `Calibrated ∧ Permitted ∧ EnvRangeOK`. **\[E]**
* **Running** — executing a method step (**with contemporaneous StateAssertion**). **\[E]**
* **Degraded** — still operable under derated envelope. **\[E]** (if policy allows)
* **Quarantined** — suspected hazard; no enactment.

**Checklist gist**

* *Calibrated*: `CalibrationAge≤30d ∧ SelfTestPass=true`.
* *Permitted*: `SafetyInterlock = Clear ∧ NoOpenIncident(sev≥High)`.
* *Ready*: *Calibrated ∧ Permitted ∧* environment in spec.

**Guards**

* Admission `→ Calibrated`: calibration record timestamp ≤30d.
* Maintenance `Ready ↺`: env sensors within limits; no new hazard event.
* Exit `Ready → Quarantined`: detected leak OR hazard alarm.
* Transition `Running → Ready`: step completed ∧ cool‑down satisfied.
* Transition `Ready → Degraded`: `DegradationIndex∈[d₁,d₂]` ∧ derate policy active.

#### A.2.5:12.3 - ObserverRole (measurement actor, incl. SOSA/SSN style)

**Context sketch:** `Lab_Thermo_2025`.
**RCS:** *CalibrationAge, TraceabilityChainOK, DriftRate, SyncError, CleanlinessScore.*

**States `S`**

* **Unqualified** — no metrological chain.
* **Calibrated** — with traceability to standard.
* **Synchronized** — time/phase sync within tolerance.
* **In‑Range** — drift & environment within spec.
* **Measuring** — performing observation. **\[E]**
* **Stale** — calibration or sync expired.
* **Quarantined** — suspect bias/contamination.

**Checklist gist**

* *Calibrated*: traceability cert valid; calibration within period.
* *Synchronized*: `SyncError≤ε`.
* *In‑Range*: drift ≤ threshold; contamination tests passed.
* *Measuring*: *Calibrated ∧ Synchronized ∧ In‑Range* AND observation procedure active.

**Guards**

* Admission `→ Calibrated`: calibration event recorded < 180d.
* Exit `Calibrated → Stale`: calibration age > threshold.
* Exit `In‑Range → Quarantined`: contamination alert OR failed control sample.
* Transition `Measuring → In‑Range`: procedure complete.

> **Note.** Many ObserverRole states are **pre‑enactment** gates; only **Measuring** is enactable.


#### A.2.5:12.4 - Epistemic/status roles (no enactment)

These roles are **status‑only**; **`S_en = ∅`**. They **gate decisions** (e.g., can be cited, can constrain), but can never authorize `U.Work`.

##### A.2.5:12.4.1 - NormativeStandardRole

**States:** *Draft*, *Candidate*, *Approved*, *Superseded*, *Deprecated*.
**Checklist gist:** governance decision records; publication identifiers; supersession links.
**Guards:** *Approved → Superseded* on adoption of newer edition; *Candidate → Approved* after ratification vote.

##### A.2.5:12.4.2 - EvidenceRole

**States:** *Collected*, *Verified*, *Validated*, *Obsolete*, *Contested*.
**Checklist gist:** verification/validation `U.Evaluation` present; freshness window; reproducibility tag.
**Guards:** decay to *Obsolete* by age; transition to *Contested* upon counter‑evidence.

##### A.2.5:12.4.3 - RequirementRole

**States:** *Proposed*, *Accepted*, *Implemented*, *Verified*, *Waived*.
**Checklist gist:** acceptance decision; trace links to `U.Work`; verification report; waiver authorization.
**Guards:** *Accepted → Implemented* when linked executions close; *Implemented → Verified* on passed acceptance checklist; *Any → Waived* by authorized speech‑act.


### A.2.5:13 - One‑screen authoring templates (didactic cards)

Keep each RSG **teachable on one screen**. Use the following **notation‑neutral** templates when drafting RoleDescriptions (A.2.3).

#### A.2.5:13.1 - RSG card (per Role, per Context)

```
RSG for: <RoleName>   Context: <ContextName/Edition>
RCS characteristics (gist): <characteristic1>, <characteristic2>, … 
States (◉ = enactable):
  - [◉] <StateName> — checklist gist; typical admission/maintenance/exit
  - [  ] <StateName> — … 
  - … 
Green‑Gate: step requiring <RoleName> is enactable iff holder asserts any ◉ state at Window.
Role algebra hooks: specialization (≤ … ), incompatibility (⊥ … ), bundles (⊗ … ).
```

#### A.2.5:13.2 - State checklist snippet (per State)

```
State <StateName> (enactable? yes/no)
Checklist (all must hold at Window):
  - <Observable criterion 1>  (e.g., CalibrationAge ≤ 30d)
  - <Observable criterion 2>  (e.g., exists SpeechAct(Approval) age ≤ 30d)
Maintenance (optional): <predicate> (e.g., EnvRangeOK)
Evidence Graph Ref: <Observation/Evaluation ids>
```

#### A.2.5:13.3 - Specialization refinement map (R' ≤ R)

```
Refinement map π : S(R') → S(R)
R' state        π(state in R)   entailment note (why Checklist_R' ⇒ Checklist_R)
-----------     -------------    -----------------------------------------------
<Ready+>        Ready            adds stricter fatigue & independence thresholds
<Authorized+>   Authorized       requires same approval + extra duty segregation
… 
```

#### A.2.5:13.4 - SoD focus (⊥) — enactable pairs

```
Incompatibility ⊥ (applies when both sides enactable at same Window):
  <RoleA.StateX>  ⊥  <RoleB.StateY>
  <RoleA.(any ◉)> ⊥  <RoleB.(any ◉)>   // default if not refined
Rationale: <one‑line reason>
```

> **Didactic cue.** If your “template” spills beyond a screen, you’re drifting into **workflow**. Pull back to **eligibility** (RSG) and **recognition** (checklists).


### A.2.5:14 - Cross‑context adjustments (via Bridges, not imports)

RSGs are **context‑local**. When similar roles appear in different Contexts, relate them with an **Alignment Bridge** (F.9), never by silently importing state names.

#### A.2.5:14.1 - State name correspondence (lossy mapping)

**Bridge example:** *Observer readiness* across two contexts:

```
Bridge: Observer-RSG alignment
From: Lab_Thermo_2025.ObserverRole
To:   Metrology_Line_2025.ObserverRole
Map (with CL):
  Calibrated(Lab)     ≈  Calibrated(Metro)            CL=3 (minor criterion diffs)
  In‑Range(Lab)       ↘  Fit‑for‑Use(Metro)           CL=2 (Metro adds robustness test)
  Measuring(Lab)      ↔  Measuring(Metro)             CL=3
Notes: 'Synchronized' in Lab maps to 'Time‑Aligned' in Metro (terminology shift).
Losses: Metro’s 'Robustness' has no direct Lab counterpart (explicit loss recorded).
```

**Rule (RSG‑X1).** A Bridge **MUST** record **losses** and **extra criteria**; it **MUST NOT** assert identity without a stated `CL` (congruence level).

#### A.2.5:14.2 - Authorization vocabulary drift (deontic vs operational)

**Bridge note:** In some IT change contexts, “**Authorized**” (deontic) overlaps with “**Permitted**” (operational). A Bridge can **explain** the design choice:

* `Authorized(AgentialRole@ITIL)` ↔ `Permitted(TransformerRole@IEC)` with **CL=1** and a note: *operational interlock ≠ managerial approval; both required to lift to Ready under our policy.*

> **Payoff.** Bridges keep **local honesty** while enabling **Cross‑context reasoning** with explicit penalties (B.3).


### A.2.5:15 - Author conformance (write good RSGs)

When you define or revise an RSG, check these **concept‑level** rules. They are easy to hold in mind; no tooling implied.

**CC‑RSG‑01 (Locality).** State names and meanings are **scoped** to `(Role, Context)`. Reuse across contexts **only via a Bridge** (F.9).

**CC‑RSG‑02 (Enactability).** Mark **which** states are enactable (**S\_en**). If none are, the role is **status‑only** (valid); then it **cannot** open the Green‑Gate.

**CC‑RSG‑03 (Observable criteria).** Every checklist item must be **observable** (Observation, Work record, SpeechAct, or derived Evaluation). No opinions.

**CC‑RSG‑04 (Guard discipline).** Guards **gate change**, checklists **recognise state**. Don’t smuggle **task order** into guards; workflow lives elsewhere (A.15).

**CC‑RSG‑05 (Refinement map).** If you declare `R' ≤ R`, provide a **π‑map** and ensure **entailment** (RSG‑R1). Specialist states may be **stricter**, never **weaker**.

**CC‑RSG‑06 (SoD by state).** Define **⊥** in terms of **enactable pairs**. Avoid blanket ⊥ if finer, state‑aware rules reduce false conflicts.

**CC‑RSG‑07 (Human scale).** Default to **≤ 7 states**. If you exceed, add a one‑sentence **didactic rationale** (“distinct gate we will actually use”).

**CC‑RSG‑08 (Green‑Gate wiring).** Ensure every `MethodDescription` step that requires this Role **names** the **◉ states** it expects, or relies on the default “any ◉”.

**CC‑RSG‑09 (Window clarity).** Checklists specify **freshness windows**; state assertions are **Window‑bound** and **non‑permanent**.

**CC‑RSG‑10 (Status/behaviour split).** Epistemic/status roles: **`S_en = ∅`**. They gate **decisions**, not **Work**. Behavioural roles require `U.System` holders (A.2.1).

### A.2.5:16 - Extended grounding across four disciplines

Each vignette shows **(i)** the **Context**, **Role**, **RCS characteristics**, **States** (◉ = enactable), **Green‑Gate** condition, and **how a `U.Work` is gated** by a `U.RoleAssignment`+RSG. Names are **context‑local**.

#### A.2.5:16.1 - Clinical surgery (medicine)

**Context.** `Hospital.OR_2026`
**Role.** `SurgeonRole` (AgentialRole)
**RCS characteristics.** *CompetenceLevel, FatigueIndex, AuthorizationValidity, CaseComplexityBand, TeamSoD*.

**States.**

* **Unprepared** — training/recency incomplete.
* **Prepared** — credentials valid; recency ≤ 90 days.
* **Authorized** — procedure‑specific approval active.
* **Ready** — `Prepared ∧ Authorized ∧ FatigueIndex<τ ∧ TeamSoD_OK`. **◉**
* **Operating** — currently performing steps. **◉**
* **Suspended** — incident or conflict raised.
* **Revoked** — approval expired/withdrawn.

**Green‑Gate.** A `MethodDescription` step tagged `requires: SurgeonRole` is **enactable** iff the performer’s `RoleAssignment` asserts **Ready** at the **Window**.

**Work gating.**
`performedBy = Dr.Kim#SurgeonRole:Hospital.OR_2026` is **valid** for step *“Incision”* only when `Ready(Dr.Kim, SurgeonRole, OR_2026, W)` holds (checklist items: approval id, fatigue score, SoD against *AuditorRole*).


#### A.2.5:16.2 - Software operations (SRE)

**Context.** `SRE_Prod_Cluster_EU_2026`
**Role.** `IncidentCommanderRole` (AgentialRole)
**RCS characteristics.** *OnCallStatus, PageFreshness, AuthorityToken, CognitiveLoad, ConflictSoD*.

**States.**

* **Off‑Duty** — not on call.
* **On‑Call** — rota active; page reachable.
* **Authorized** — escalation token valid.
* **Ready** — `On‑Call ∧ Authorized ∧ CognitiveLoad≤k ∧ SoD_OK`. **◉**
* **RunningIncident** — commanding an active incident. **◉**
* **CoolingDown** — post‑incident refractory period.
* **Blocked** — conflict with *ChangeAuthorRole* detected.

**Green‑Gate.** Steps in *“Major Incident Process”* that `require: IncidentCommanderRole` open only with **Ready**.

**Work gating.**
`performedBy = Dana#IncidentCommanderRole:SRE_Prod_Cluster_EU_2026` is **invalid** for “Declare SEV‑1” if `ConflictSoD(ChangeAuthorRole)` holds or `PageFreshness>5 min`.


#### A.2.5:16.3 - Laboratory metrology

**Context.** `Metrology_Thermo_2026`
**Role.** `ThermometerObserverRole` (ObserverRole)
**RCS characteristics.** *CalibrationAge, DriftRate, TraceabilityChainOK, CleanlinessScore, SyncError*.

**States.**

* **Unqualified** — missing traceability.
* **Calibrated** — cert valid (≤ 180 d); drift within baseline.
* **Synchronized** — `SyncError≤ε`.
* **In‑Range** — contamination absent; env OK.
* **Measuring** — procedure active. **◉**
* **Stale** — calibration/sync expired.
* **Quarantined** — suspected bias.

**Green‑Gate.** `MethodDescription` step *“Record temperature”* is enactable only in state **Measuring** (which requires *Calibrated ∧ Synchronized ∧ In‑Range*).

**Work gating.**
`performedBy = SensorT‑17#ThermometerObserverRole:Metrology_Thermo_2026` is **rejected** if `CalibrationAge>180 d` or `ControlSampleBias>δ`.


#### A.2.5:16.4 - Governance / compliance

**Context.** `Finance_Audit_2026`
**Role.** `IndependentAuditorRole` (AgentialRole) and `EvidenceRole` (status‑only)
**RCS (auditor).** *CertificationLevel, IndependenceFlag, AssignmentToken, CaseLoad*.
**States (auditor).** **Ready**/**Auditing** as in §12.1; **⊥** with `DeveloperRole`.
**RCS (evidence).** *VerificationStatus, ValidationStatus, Age, ProvenanceChainOK*.
**States (evidence).** *Collected, Verified, Validated, Contested, Obsolete* (status‑only).

**Green‑Gate.** Audit step `requires: IndependentAuditorRole` — enactable only with **Ready** and **⊥ DeveloperRole** at the Window. Evidence states **gate decisions** (e.g., “accept finding”), never open Work.

**Work gating.**
`performedBy = Alice#IndependentAuditorRole:Finance_Audit_2026` **fails** if Alice holds any overlapping `DeveloperRole` binding in the same context.


### A.2.5:17 - Acceptance harness (static conformance)

Author‑facing checks; **notation‑free**, **concept‑level**. Use them when drafting or reviewing an RSG.

**SCR‑A.2.5‑S01 - Local scope.** Every state name is qualified by `(Role, Context)`. No global states.
**SCR‑A.2.5‑S02 - Enactability mark.** The set **S\_en** is explicit; each ◉ state is listed.
**SCR‑A.2.5‑S03 - Observable checklists.** Each state has a Checklist of **observable** predicates (Observation / Evaluation / SpeechAct / Work evidence).
**SCR‑A.2.5‑S04 - Green‑Gate wiring.** Every `MethodDescription` step that names the Role either (a) names its ◉ state(s) or (b) relies on the default “any ◉” policy; the RSG declares which.
**SCR‑A.2.5‑S05 - Guard discipline.** Guards only **gate transitions**; they do not encode task order.
**SCR‑A.2.5‑S06 - SoD by state.** Incompatibilities (⊥) are declared over **states** (or “any ◉”), not over bare role names.
**SCR‑A.2.5‑S07 - Specialisation entailment.** For every `R' ≤ R`, a refinement map `π: S(R')→S(R)` is provided; each mapped pair has an entailment note (why `Checklist_R' ⇒ Checklist_R`).
**SCR‑A.2.5‑S08 - Human scale.** `|S| ≤ 7` unless a one‑line didactic rationale is recorded.
**SCR‑A.2.5‑S09 - Status‑only roles.** If `S_en=∅`, the Role is explicitly tagged **status‑only**; it cannot open the Green‑Gate.
**SCR‑A.2.5‑S10 - Bridge discipline.** Any cross‑context reuse is via an Alignment Bridge (F.9) with recorded `CL` and losses; no silent imports.


### A.2.5:18 - Regression harness (evolution checks)

Use when **adding/removing states**, **changing criteria**, or **bridging** across contexts.

**RSCR‑A.2.5‑R01 - State churn impact.** For every added/removed/renamed state, list affected `MethodDescription` steps and `Work` validators; confirm the Green‑Gate policy remains decidable.
**RSCR‑A.2.5‑R02 - Entailment stability.** When `R' ≤ R` changes, update the `π` map and re‑justify entailments; fail the check if any previously valid entailment breaks.
**RSCR‑A.2.5‑R03 - SoD coverage.** After edits, recompute the set of **enactable pairs**; verify declared ⊥ still blocks all intended conflicts and no longer blocks permitted cases.
**RSCR‑A.2.5‑R04 - Evidence freshness.** If any checklist predicate uses **age/freshness**, ensure default Windows are documented and existing state assertions re‑evaluate accordingly.
**RSCR‑A.2.5‑R05 - Bridge congruence drift.** If a Bridge maps states with `CL=k`, and either side’s checklist changes, revisit the mapping; **do not** keep `CL` unchanged by default—raise or lower with a short rationale.
**RSCR‑A.2.5‑R06 - Status/behaviour split.** Verify behavioural roles still require `U.System` holders (A.2.1); status‑only roles still have `S_en=∅`.
**RSCR‑A.2.5‑R07 - One‑screen rule.** If cumulative edits push the RSG beyond one screen, split states or tighten criteria; record a one‑line teaching rationale if you must exceed.


### A.2.5:19 - Common failure modes (and quick remedies)

| Failure            | Symptom                               | Why it hurts                       | Quick remedy                                                              |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Workflow creep** | Guards encode task order              | RSG becomes a hidden workflow model | Move ordering to `MethodDescription`; keep guards as **eligibility** only |
| **Vague criteria** | “experienced”, “mature” in checklists | Non‑decidable Green‑Gate           | Replace with observable proxies (hours, exam score, age thresholds)       |
| **Global states**  | “Ready” reused across contexts        | Meaning leakage                    | Qualify by `(Role, Context)`; use Bridges for Cross‑context talk             |
| **Over‑broad ⊥**   | Many false conflicts                  | Blocks delivery                    | Make ⊥ **state‑aware**; restrict to enactable pairs                       |
| **Missing π‑map**  | Specialisation with no entailment     | Unsafe substitutions               | Add `π` and entailment notes; otherwise drop `≤`                          |


### A.2.5:20 - Didactic script (90 seconds): how A.2.5 ties to A.2.1 & A.2.3

> \*“A role assignment says **who wears which mask where** (A.2.1). The **RoleStateGraph** says **when that mask is actually wearable**. Each role’s RSG is a **small named state space** with **checklists** for each state. Some states are **enactable** (◉): they open the **Green‑Gate** for `Work`. Others are **status‑only**: they gate decisions, never execution.
>
> A **RoleDescription** (A.2.3) is where you publish the role’s **RCS** (characteristics), its **RSG** (states + checklists + guards), and any **role algebra** (≤, ⊥, ⊗) specific to your context.
>
> In practice: a `MethodDescription` step lists **required roles**; at runtime, a `Work` record is valid only if its **performer** is a `RoleAssignment` whose RSG asserts an **enactable** state at the **Window**. That’s the Green‑Gate.
>
> Different Contexts may use the same role labels. We never assume global meaning; we relate Contexts with **Bridges** that map states and record losses.
>
> Keep each RSG **on one screen**, with **observable** checklists. If you’re writing task order, you’ve slipped into workflow—move it to the Method. If you’re writing opinions, convert them into **observables** or drop them. That’s the whole trick.”\*


### A.2.5:21 - Relations (quick pointers)

* **Builds on:** A.2.1 `U.RoleAssignment` (the binding that can assert states); A.2.3 `U.RoleDescription` (the carrier of RSG); E.10.D1 (Context discipline).
* **Enables.** A.15 (Role‑Method‑Work Alignment via Green‑Gate); B.3 (Trust penalties when crossing Bridges with lower `CL`).
* **Interacts with.** D‑cluster deontics (speech‑acts gate **Authorized**‑like states for agential roles); F.9 (state‑level alignment across contexts).
