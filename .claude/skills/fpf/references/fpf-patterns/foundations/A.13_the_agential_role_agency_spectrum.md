## A.13 - The Agential Role & Agency Spectrum

> *“Agency is not a kind of thing; it is a way some systems operate.”*

### A.13:1 - Intent & Context

The concept of "agency"—the capacity of an entity to act purposefully—is central to engineering, biology, and AI, yet it remains one of the most overloaded and ambiguous terms. Without a precise, falsifiable, and substrate-neutral definition, models of autonomous systems risk descending into "self-magic," where actions have no clear cause and accountability is lost.

This pattern builds directly upon the foundations laid in the FPF Kernel to provide that definition. A.1 established that only a **`U.System`** can be the bearer (`holder`) of behavioral roles.  A.2.1 defined the universal `U.RoleAssignment` (`Holder#Role:Context`) as the canonical way to assign roles. A.3 and A.12 defined the `TransformerRole` and the principle of the external agent.

The intent of this pattern is to:
1.  Formally define **agency** not as an intrinsic *type* of holon, but as a **contextual Role Assignment**.
2.  Introduce a measurable, multi-dimensional **spectrum of agency** via a dedicated Characterization (`Agency-CHR`), moving beyond a simple binary "agent/not-agent" switch.
3.  Provide a clear, **didactic grading system** that allows engineers and managers to assess and communicate the level of autonomy of any system in a consistent, evidence-backed manner.

### A.13:2 - Problem

If agency is treated as a monolithic, intrinsic property or a mere label, four critical failure modes emerge, undermining the rigor of FPF:

1.  **Episteme-as-Actor:** Models might incorrectly assign agency to knowledge artifacts (`U.Episteme`), leading to nonsensical claims like "the specification decided to update the system." This is a direct violation of **Strict Distinction (A.7)**.
2.  **Type Inflation:** Introducing a `U.Agent` as a new base type alongside `U.System` and `U.Episteme` would violate **Ontological Parsimony (C-5)** and create conflicts with the dynamic nature of roles. A system might act as an agent in one context and a passive component in another; a static type cannot capture this.
3.  **Unfalsifiable Claims:** Without a measurable basis, "agency" becomes a subjective label. A team might call their system an "agent" for marketing purposes, but this claim has no verifiable meaning and cannot be audited, violating **Evidence Graph Referring (A.10)**.
4.  **The Binary Trap:** A simple "agent/not-agent" classification is too coarse. It fails to distinguish between a simple thermostat, a predictive cruise control system, and a strategic, self-learning robotic swarm, even though their cognitive capabilities differ by orders of magnitude.

### A.13:3 - Forces

| Force | Tension |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Scientific Fidelity vs. Simplicity** | Contemporary science (e.g., Active Inference) models agency as a continuous, scale-free spectrum. FPF needs to honor this rigor while providing a simple, teachable model for practitioners. |
| **Role vs. Type** | The intuition is to think of an "Agent" as a *type* of thing. FPF's architecture demands that it be modeled as a *role* to preserve dynamism and ontological hygiene. |
| **Measurement vs. Label** | Engineers and managers need a quick, intuitive label (e.g., "this is a Level 3 agent"), while formal assurance requires a detailed, multi-dimensional, evidence-backed measurement. |
| **System-only Action vs. Collective Action**| How does agency apply to groups like teams or swarms? This requires a clear link to the rule from A.1 that any *acting group* must be modeled as a `U.System`. |

### A.13:4 - Solution

FPF's solution is threefold: it defines an Agent via `U.RoleAssignment` (A.2.1), makes agency measurable with a dedicated Characterization, and provides a didactic summary via a graded scale.

#### A.13:4.1 - The Core Definition: Agent as a Contextual Role Assignment

An **"Agent"** in FPF is not a fundamental type. It is a convenience term (a Register 1 / Register 2 label) for a specific kind of **Contextual Role Assignment (`U.RoleAssignment`)**:

> `Agent ≍ U.RoleAssignment(holder: U.System, role: U.AgentialRole, context: U.BoundedContext)`

This means an Agent is simply a **`U.System`** that is currently playing an **`AgentialRole`** within a specific **`U.BoundedContext`**.

*   **No `U.Agent` Type:** To be clear, there is **no `U.Agent` base type** in the FPF Kernel. This avoids type inflation and preserves the dynamic nature of roles.
*   **Epistemes Cannot Be Agents:** As the `holder` must be a `U.System`, this definition constitutionally forbids `U.Episteme`s from being agents, preventing the "episteme-as-actor" category error.
*   **Canonical Syntax:** The technical notation for an agent is `System#AgentialRole:Context`.

#### A.13:4.2 - The `AgentialRole` and its Specializations

*   **`U.AgentialRole`:** This is the abstract `U.Role` that grants a `U.System` the capacity for goal-directed action within a context. It is the "license to act."
*   **Specialized Roles:** More specific behavioral roles like `TransformerRole` and `ObserverRole` are considered **specializations or sub-roles** of `AgentialRole`. They describe *what kind* of agential action is being performed at a given moment.
    *   A system playing `TransformerRole` is an Agent *that is currently modifying another holon*.
    *   A system playing `ObserverRole` is an Agent *that is currently gathering information*.
    This creates a clean hierarchy: a `Transformer` is always an `Agent`, but an `Agent` is not always a `Transformer` (it could be observing, planning, or idle).

#### A.13:4.3 - Measuring Agency: The `Agency-CHR` and the Spectrum

Agency is not a binary switch; it is a multi-dimensional spectrum of capabilities. FPF models this using a dedicated pattern, **`Agency-CHR` (C.9)**, which is a **Characterization** that attaches a set of measurable properties to a `U.RoleAssignment`.

The `Agency-CHR` profile is grounded in contemporary research (e.g., Active Inference, Basal Cognition) and includes the following key characteristics. Each is measured for a specific agent in a specific context and must be backed by evidence (A.10).

1.  **Boundary Maintenance Capacity (BMC):** The ability of the system to maintain its structural and functional integrity against perturbations. *(How robust is it?)*
2.  **Predictive Horizon (PH):** The temporal or causal depth of the agent's internal model. *(How far ahead can it "see"?)*
3.  **Model Plasticity (MP):** The rate at which the agent can update its internal model (`U.GenerativeModel`) in response to prediction errors (`U.Error`). *(How quickly can it learn?)*
4.  **Policy Enactment Reliability (PER):** The probability that the agent will successfully execute its chosen `U.Method` under operational conditions. *(How reliably does it do what it decides to do?)*
5.  **Objective Complexity (OC):** A measure of the complexity of the `U.Objective` the agent can pursue, from simple set-points to abstract, multi-scale goals.

#### A.13:4.4 - The Agency Grade (Didactic Layer)

While the multi-dimensional `Agency-CHR` profile is essential for formal assurance, engineers and managers need a simpler, at-a-glance summary. The **Agency Grade** is a **non-normative, didactic** scale from 0 to 4 that synthesizes the CHR profile into an intuitive level of autonomy.

| Grade | Label | Typical `Agency-CHR` Profile (Conservative Lower Bound) | Archetypal Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0** | **Non-Agential** | `BMC ≈ 0`, `PH ≈ 0`, `MP ≈ 0` | A rock, a document, a passive structural component. |
| **1** | **Reactive** | `BMC > 0`, `PH ≈ 0`, `MP ≈ 0` | A thermostat; a simple feedback controller. Follows fixed rules. |
| **2** | **Predictive** | `BMC > 0`, `PH > 0`, `MP ≈ 0` | A model-predictive controller with a fixed model; a chess engine that plans moves but doesn't learn new strategies. |
| **3** | **Adaptive** | `BMC > 0`, `PH > 0`, `MP > 0` | A self-calibrating sensor system; a machine learning agent that updates its model with new data. |
| **4** | **Reflective/Strategic** | High `BMC`, `PH`, `MP`, `PER`, and `OC`. Capable of meta-cognition (reasoning about its own reasoning) and pursuing abstract goals. | An autonomous R&D system; a cohesive, self-organizing DevOps team. |

**Crucial Distinction:** The `Agency-CHR` profile is the **normative evidence**. The Grade is a **pedagogical shortcut**. An artifact cannot claim a grade without having a corresponding, auditable CHR profile to back it up.

### A.13:5 - Archetypal Grounding

The universal pattern of agency, defined as a `Contextual Role Assignment` and measured by the `Agency-CHR`, manifests across all domains. The following table demonstrates its application to the FPF's two primary archetypes: a `U.System` and a collective `U.System` (a team), while explicitly showing why a `U.Episteme` cannot be an agent.

| Archetype | Holder (`U.System`) | Role & Context (`#Role:Context`) | `Agency-CHR` Profile Sketch | Resulting Agency Grade |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Simple Controller** | `Thermostat_Model_T800` | `#AgentialRole:HomeHeatingSystem` | `BMC`: High (maintains temp). <br> `PH`: Zero (no prediction). <br> `MP`: Zero (fixed logic). <br> `PER`: Very High. <br> `OC`: Low (single set-point). | **Grade 1 (Reactive)** |
| **Advanced Controller** | `PredictiveCruiseControl_v3` | `#AgentialRole:VehicleDynamics` | `BMC`: High. <br> `PH`: High (predicts traffic flow). <br> `MP`: Zero (fixed model). <br> `PER`: High. <br> `OC`: Medium (optimization). | **Grade 2 (Predictive)** |
| **Learning System** | `SelfCalibratingSensorArray` | `#AgentialRole:IndustrialProcess` | `BMC`: High. <br> `PH`: High. <br> `MP`: Medium (learns drift). <br> `PER`: High. <br> `OC`: Medium. | **Grade 3 (Adaptive)** |
| **Collective Agent** | `DevOpsTeam_Phoenix` (a collective `U.System`) | `#AgentialRole:ProjectPhoenix` | `BMC`: High (maintains velocity). <br> `PH`: High (sprint planning). <br> `MP`: High (retrospectives). <br> `PER`: Medium-High. <br> `OC`: High (abstract business goals). | **Grade 4 (Reflective/Strategic)** |
| **Knowledge Artifact** | `ISO_26262_Standard.pdf` (`U.Episteme`) | **N/A** (Cannot be a holder of an `AgentialRole`) | N/A | **Grade 0 (Non-Agential)** |

**Key takeaway from grounding:**
This table makes the abstract model concrete. It shows that the FPF agency model can precisely differentiate between simple controllers and complex learning systems. It also reinforces the **Strict Distinction** principle: the ISO standard (`U.Episteme`) is a crucial **justification (`justification?`)** for the actions of an agent (like the DevOps team), but it is never an agent itself.

### A.13:6 - Conformance Checklist

To ensure the agency model is applied rigorously and consistently, all FPF artifacts must adhere to the following normative checks.

| ID | Requirement (Normative Predicate) | Purpose / Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CC-A13.1 (Holder Type)** | The `holder` of a `U.RoleAssignment` with `role: U.AgentialRole` **MUST** be a `U.System`. | Prevents the "episteme-as-actor" category error. Enforces **Strict Distinction (A.7)**. |
| **CC-A13.2 (RoleAssignment Mandate)** | Any claim of agency **MUST** be represented by a complete `U.RoleAssignment` instance, including an explicit `holder`, `role`, and `context`. | Ensures that agency is always modeled as contextual and bound to a specific bearer, not as a free-floating property. |
| **CC-A13.3 (CHR Evidence)** | Any claim about an Agent's grade or level of autonomy **MUST** be substantiated by an auditable `Agency-CHR` profile with Evidence Graph Ref (A.10). | Makes claims of agency falsifiable and prevents "agency by marketing." |
| **CC-A13.4 (Grade is Didactic)**| The **Agency Grade (0-4)** **SHALL NOT** be used as a normative input for formal reasoning. It is a didactic summary of the `Agency-CHR` profile. | Prevents oversimplification in formal models. The detailed profile, not the summary grade, must be used for assurance cases. |
| **CC-A13.5 (Collective as System)** | To claim agency for a collective (e.g., a team, a swarm), the collective **MUST** first be modeled as a `U.System` with a defined `U.Boundary` and a coordination `U.Method`. | Prevents the error of assigning agency to a mere set or collection (`MemberOf`). Aligns with **A.1** and **A.14**. |
| **CC-A13.6 (MHT for Emergent Agency)** | If a collection of systems, previously non-agential or at a lower grade, develops a new supervisory structure and crosses a documented `Agency-CHR` threshold, a **Meta-Holon Transition (MHT, B.2)** **MUST** be declared. | Makes the emergence of collective agency an explicit, auditable event, preventing "magic" emergence. |

### A.13:7 - Consequences

| Benefits | Trade-offs / Mitigations |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Category Safety & Clarity:** The pattern provides a clear, unambiguous definition of agency that prevents common modeling errors and is consistent across all of FPF. | **Increased Modeling Granularity:** Requires modelers to think in terms of Role-assignments and contexts, which is slightly more complex than just labeling something an "Agent." *Mitigation:* The `Holon#Role:Context` syntax and tooling support make this manageable in practice. |
| **Falsifiable & Measurable Agency:** By grounding agency in the `Agency-CHR`, the framework transforms a vague philosophical concept into a set of concrete, evidence-backed engineering properties. | **Measurement Effort:** Populating the `Agency-CHR` profile requires real work (testing, analysis, data gathering). *Mitigation:* The profile can be built iteratively. An initial estimate can be used, with the understanding that its `Reliability (R)` score is low until backed by evidence. |
| **Scalable Autonomy Model:** The graded scale provides a sophisticated language for describing and comparing different levels of autonomy, from simple automation to strategic intelligence. | **Risk of Misinterpreting Grades:** The simple 0-4 scale could be misused as a simplistic marketing label. *Mitigation:* The normative requirement (**CC-A13.4**) to always link a grade to its underlying CHR profile acts as a guardrail against this. |
| **Elegant Handling of Collectives:** The pattern provides a clean way to model the agency of teams, swarms, and organizations without violating ontological principles. | - |

### A.13:8 - Rationale

This pattern's strength comes from its synthesis of contemporary, post-2015 research into a single, operational model.

*   **Grounded in Science:** The move away from a binary, type-based view of agency towards a **graded, spectrum-based model** is directly aligned with modern research in Active Inference (Friston et al.), Basal Cognition (Fields, Levin), and evolutionary cybernetics. The `Agency-CHR` provides a direct, practical implementation of these ideas.
*   **Ontologically Sound:** By defining an Agent as a **Contextual Role Assignment**, the pattern avoids the ontological pitfalls of creating a new base type. It fully embraces the FPF's core architectural principle of separating **substance (`holder`)** from **function (`role`)** within a **context**. This aligns with best practices from foundational ontologies (like UFO) and the principles of **Strict Distinction (A.7)**.
*   **Pragmatic and Actionable:** The pattern is designed for engineers and managers. The `Agency Grade` provides a quick communication tool, while the underlying `Agency-CHR` provides the detailed, auditable data needed for formal assurance and risk management. This duality satisfies both **Didactic Primacy (P-2)** and **Pragmatic Utility (P-7)**.

In essence, this pattern does not *invent* a new theory of agency. It **distills and operationalizes** the emerging scientific consensus, packaging it into a rigorous, falsifiable, and practical tool for the FPF ecosystem.

### A.13:9 - Relations

*   **Builds on:**
    *   `A.1 Holonic Foundation`: Establishes that only `U.System`s can be bearers of behavioral roles.
    *   `A.2 Role Taxonomy`: Provides the universal  Contextual Role Assignment (`U.RoleAssignment`) mechanism.
    *   `A.12 External Transformer`: The actions of an Agent are modeled using the external transformer principle.
*   **Coordinates with:**
    *   `B.2 Meta-Holon Transition (MHT)`: A significant jump in the `Agency-CHR` of a collective can trigger an MHT.
    *   `B.3 Trust & Assurance Calculus`: The `Agency-CHR` profile provides crucial inputs for assessing the reliability and safety of an autonomous system.
    *   `D.2 Multi-Scale Ethics Framework`: The Agency Grade is used to determine the level of moral responsibility and accountability assigned to a system.
*   **Instantiates:**
    *   The `Agency-CHR` (C.9), which provides the formal definitions for the characteristics (BMC, PH, etc.).
