## A.19.UNM - Unified Normalization Mechanism (UNM)

> **Type:** Architectural (A)  
> **Status:** Stable  
> **Normativity:** Normative (unless explicitly marked informative)
> **Placement:** Part A / CN‑Spec cluster (A.19) / CHR mechanism owner patterns 
> **Semantic owner note (Phase‑3 canonicalization):** This pattern is the designated **single semantic owner** of the *meaning* of `UNM.IntensionRef` (per `E.20`). The canonical publication anchor for `UNM.IntensionRef` remains `A.19.UNM`, while `A.6.1` remains the owner of the `U.Mechanism.Intension` **template**.  
> **Non‑ownership note:** The `CN_Spec` surface itself (incl. `CN_Spec.normalization` and `CN_Spec.comparability`) remains owned by `A.19.CN`; this pattern specifies only UNM’s stable semantic surface and how UNM **consumes/interprets** the CN‑frame routing fields (no shadow CN‑spec).  
> **ID‑continuity:** legacy UNM mentions remain valid via *Tell + Cite* stubs (e.g., cite `A.19.UNM:4.1`).  
> **Canonicalization hook (Phase‑3):** Any other location that mentions UNM (including legacy “card fragments”) SHALL be reduced to *Tell + Cite* and SHALL NOT restate `SlotIndex / OperationAlgebra / LawSet / AdmissibilityConditions / Applicability / Transport / Γ_timePolicy / PlaneRegime / Audit`. This is the usability+didactic guard against “scattered semantics”.
**If someone says “we normalized”, ask (in this order):**
1) Which **`UNM_id`** (if applicable) and which **`NormalizationMethodInstanceId`** (and its validity window) was used?  
2) Which **`NormalizationInvariant[*]`** were declared (i.e., *what is preserved*)?  
3) Where are the **evidence pins** and any **transport / plane** pins (Bridge/CL/ReferencePlane + `UNM.TransportRegistryΦ/Phi` if invoked)?

**Mental model.** UNM **re‑parameterizes** a raw coordinate value (`CV`) into an `NCV` *under declared invariants* and exposes `≡_UNM` so downstream steps can be stated as “compare on invariants” *explicitly* (and audited).


### A.19.UNM:0 - At a glance — didactic, informative

**Intent.** Provide a single, explicit normalization mechanism for **coordinate values** in a `U.CharacteristicSpace`, so that **comparability** and downstream characterization steps can be stated as “**normalize-then-compare**” (governance), rather than as hidden arithmetic inside scoring/selection.

**Where it sits.**
- **CN-frame governance surface:** `CN_Spec.normalization` + `CN_Spec.comparability.mode` route whether comparison is `coordinatewise` or `normalization-based`.  
- **CHR suite role:** stage `normalize` (first-stage, when enabled by the suite protocol / comparability routing).

**Key outputs.**
- `NCV` (NormalizedCharacteristicValue) values for coordinates.
- A declared congruence `≡_UNM` (equivalence) induced by a chosen normalization method instance.
- Optionally, an explicit representative selection policy (`NormalizationFixSpec`, aka “NormalizationFix” in prose) when quotient objects must be presented as concrete chart items.

**Two IDs (do not conflate).**
- `UNM_id?` selects the **UNM mechanism instance** used by this CN‑frame (a `U.Mechanism` instance of type UNM; routing/governance level).
- `NormalizationMethodInstanceId` selects the **normalization method instance** applied to specific coordinate(s), with its validity window and evidence pins (method/application level).

**Minimum declaration set (didactic).**
- In `CN_Spec.comparability`: set `mode`, and (when UNM participates in acceptance/comparison) set `minimal_evidence`.
- In `CN_Spec.normalization`: declare `UNM_id?`, `methods`, `instances`, `method_descriptions`, `invariants`, and (if representatives are required) `fix`.
- In Audit: cite the chosen `NormalizationMethodInstanceId`, `NormalizationMethodDescriptionRef.edition`, declared invariants, validity window, evidence pins, and any Bridge/CL/ReferencePlane pins (plus the edition pin `UNM.TransportRegistryΦ/Phi` when transport is invoked).

**Non-goals.**
- Not indicator selection (that is **UINDM**).
- Not scoring, aggregation, comparison, selection (USCM / ULSAM / CPM / SelectorMechanism).
- Not a data governance system: UNM is a concept-level mechanism with explicit semantic ownership and auditability.

**Single-owner note (Phase‑3 canonicalization).**
This pattern is intended to become the **single semantic owner** of the canonical `U.Mechanism.Intension` for `UNM.IntensionRef`. Other locations that currently carry UNM “card fragments” should be reduced to **Tell + Cite** stubs pointing here, preserving public IDs/anchors.

### A.19.UNM:1 - Problem frame

FPF needs a disciplined way to talk about **measurable slots** (coordinates/scales) such that engineers can reason about:
- **What it means** to compare values across charts/slices/contexts, and
- **Where the “meaning-preserving” transformations live**, so comparisons are lawful and explainable.

In practice, teams routinely face a mismatch between:
- values that look comparable (“they’re numbers”), and  
- values that are not comparable without normalization (different units, scale types, reference planes, context semantics, or validity windows).

FPF’s CHR family explicitly separates stages (normalize → indicatorize → score → fold → compare → select). UNM is the *normalization* stage, and its job is to make “compare-on-invariants” explicit and auditable.

### A.19.UNM:2 - Problem

Without an explicit UNM owner pattern:

1) **Normalization drifts into hidden places.** It gets embedded inside scoring, comparison, or selection, making legality and governance non-local.

2) **Comparability becomes rhetorical.** People say “we normalize” but cannot answer:  
   *Which method? Which invariants? Which validity window? Which evidence? Which transport/plane regime?*

3) **Cross-context and cross-plane slips become invisible.** Teams “reuse” normalizations across contexts without explicit Bridge/CL/ReferencePlane discipline.

4) **Engineers cannot reconstruct the mechanism.** When UNM semantics are scattered, the pattern structure (problem/forces/solution) is lost, hurting didactic use by engineering managers.

### A.19.UNM:3 - Forces

| Force | Tension |
|---|---|
| **Evolvability vs Usability** | Stable mechanism surface ↔ method families evolve; single place to read ↔ modular wiring. |
| **Semantic precision vs Cognitive load** | Formal invariants/quotients ↔ a mechanism description that engineers can act on. |
| **Single-owner discipline vs Cross-cutting reality** | UNM touches CN/CG/transport/planes ↔ avoid “shadow specs” and duplicate centers of gravity. |
| **Trustworthiness vs Overreach** | “Normalization is legitimate” must be evidence-backed ↔ UNM must not pretend to define measurement meaning itself. |
| **Locality vs Reuse** | Normalization is context-local ↔ reuse requires explicit transport declarations (Bridge-only). |
| **Fail-closed safety vs Convenience** | Unknown/insufficient evidence must not coerce ↔ teams want “a number anyway”. |

### A.19.UNM:4 - Solution

UNM is a `U.Mechanism` that normalizes coordinate values using declared method classes, producing:
- normalized values (`NCV`),
- an induced congruence `≡_UNM`,
- and (when needed) a representative policy (`NormalizationFix`) for quotient objects.

UNM is **not** a bag of algorithms. It is a **canonical semantic surface**:
- **Routing** lives in `CN_Spec.normalization` and `CN_Spec.comparability.mode`.
- **Evidence/calibration legitimacy** lives in `C.16 (MM‑CHR)`.
- **Method families** can be supplied by SoTA packs and wired via extensions, without mutating UNM’s surface.

#### A.19.UNM:4.0 - Vocabulary (normative)

**NormalizationMethodId.** A stable token naming a normalization method *kind*, used in `CN_Spec.normalization.methods`.

**NormalizationMethod.** The method *kind* (class) that defines:
1) the **invariants** it preserves (`NormalizationInvariant[*]`),  
2) its **closure rules** (composition, and inverses where defined), and  
3) its **validity rules** (scope / context / time window constraints).

**NormalizationMethodDescription.** An editioned epistemic description of a normalization method (bounds, validity region/window, scope constraints, and evidence links owned by `C.16`).  
**NormalizationMethodDescriptionRef.** A ref to an editioned `NormalizationMethodDescription`, used in `CN_Spec.normalization.method_descriptions`.

**NormalizationMethodInstanceId.** A stable token naming a concrete, declared application of a normalization method to specific coordinate(s)/slot(s) in a host `U.CharacteristicSpace`, with a named validity window and (when required) evidence pins. Used in `CN_Spec.normalization.instances`.

**NormalizationMethodInstance.** The instance binding itself (conceptual); referenced in specs/logs/gates by `NormalizationMethodInstanceId`.

**CV (CoordinateValue).** A raw coordinate value for a **named measurable slot** in a chart: conceptually `⟨slot_id, raw_value⟩` (plus any chart/slice scoping needed by the host). UNM re‑parameterizes `CV → NCV` under declared invariants and validity constraints.

**NCV (NormalizedCharacteristicValue).** A normalized **value** for a coordinate (UNM does **not** “normalize characteristics”; it normalizes coordinate values under declared invariants).

**`≡_UNM` (UNM‑congruence).** A context‑local equivalence relation induced by a chosen `NormalizationMethodInstance`.
Two charts (or chart items/views) are `≡_UNM` iff they are related by a finite chain of admissible transformations that preserve the declared invariants.

**NormalizationInvariant.** A named invariant (e.g., unit alignment, polarity, reference plane) declared in `CN_Spec.normalization.invariants` and/or the selected `NormalizationMethodDescription`. Preserving the declared `NormalizationInvariant[*]` is the core admissibility claim for a normalization method instance.

**NormalizationFixSpec.** A declared policy selecting a canonical representative of a `≡_UNM` equivalence class when downstream consumers require a concrete chart item/view. Bound via `CN_Spec.normalization.fix` (otherwise keep quotient objects abstract).
**UNM_id.** An optional identifier in `CN_Spec.normalization.UNM_id?` selecting the UNM **mechanism instance** used by this CN‑frame. This is routing/governance; it is distinct from `NormalizationMethodInstanceId` (method/application).
**ValidityWindow.** A named validity window attached to a `NormalizationMethodInstanceId`, bounding where/when the instance is admissible (no implicit “latest”).

**`UNM.TransportRegistryΦ`.** An editioned anchor (single‑writer under UNM authoring) that enumerates the declared transport/plane pins and Φ‑penalties used when normalizations are reused across contexts/planes. Referenced via edition pins in suite/flow contracts; never re‑authored downstream.  
**Alias:** `UNM.TransportRegistryPhi` is an ASCII‑safe alias token (dock via `F.18`); it is **not** a competing head.

**Lexical guard (strict distinction).** Avoid the word **`map`** / **`mapping`** for UNM transforms (especially `Map`), because `Map` is a specialized FPF term and creates ontology drift. Prefer “normalization”, “re‑parameterization”, “transform under invariants”.
Legacy κ‑notation for normalization is retired; do not re‑introduce it.

#### A.19.UNM:4.1 - UNM as a `U.Mechanism.Intension` (normative)

**Scope note.** This Mechanism.Intension is authored to the `U.Mechanism.Intension` **shape** owned by `A.6.1`. It defines only UNM’s stable *semantic surface*. It does **not** bind project pins (editions/policy‑ids), which belong to the P2W seam (`A.15.3` + `A.19.CHR`), and it does **not** emit `GateDecision`/`GateLog`. It may emit tri‑state `GuardDecision` and Audit pins.

**IntensionHeader**
- `IntensionId`: `UNM`
- `IntensionRef`: `UNM.IntensionRef`
- `Name`: Unified Normalization Mechanism
- `Status`: Stable
- `Version`: `v1.0`
- `SuiteRole`: CHR.normalize (when enabled by CN/CHR routing)

**Imports (cite, don’t duplicate)**
- `A.6.1` (shape: `U.Mechanism.Intension`, specialization discipline)  
- `A.6.5` (slot discipline; SlotIndex is a projection)
- `A.19.CHR:4.2` (CHR suite boundary / membership)
- `A.19.CHR:4.2.1` (CHR SlotKind Lexicon)
- `A.19.CHR:4.5` (suite protocols: ordering/optionality; suite closure)
- `A.19.CN` (CN-frame routing: `normalization`, `comparability.mode`)
- `G.0` (CG-frame legality gates where required downstream)
- `C.16` (evidence carriers; calibration/validity for normalization legitimacy)
- `A.17/A.18` (measurement meaning & scale lawfulness; not redefined here)

**SubjectBlock**
- `SubjectKind`: `NormalizationMethod classes` (with induced `≡_UNM` over charts/views)
- `BaseType`: chart/`U.CharacteristicSpace` family in a CN‑frame (one `U.BoundedContext`), where normalization acts on coordinate values (`CV`) for measurable slots (UNM normalizes **values**, not characteristics)
- `SliceSet`: `U.ContextSliceSet` (context is explicit; no implicit “global normalization”)
- `ExtentRule`: “coordinate values admitted for normalization within the declared context and the method instance validity window”
- `ResultKinds`:
  - `NormalizedCharacteristicValue (NCV)`
  - `UNM‑congruence (≡_UNM)`
  - optional quotient objects and/or `Normalization‑fixed` representatives (via `NormalizationFixSpec`)

**SlotIndex (derived projection; minimum)**
- `CharacteristicSpaceSlot : ⟨ValueKind = U.CharacteristicSpace, refMode = U.CharacteristicSpaceRef⟩`
- `CNSpecSlot : ⟨ValueKind = CN‑Spec, refMode = CNSpecRef⟩`
- `ContextSlot : ⟨ValueKind = U.BoundedContext, refMode = U.BoundedContextRef⟩`

UNM‑specific slots (must be alias‑docked into the CHR SlotKind lexicon if used across the suite):
- `NormalizationMethodInstanceSlot : ⟨ValueKind = NormalizationMethodInstanceId, refMode = ByValue⟩`
- `NormalizationMethodDescriptionSlot? : ⟨ValueKind = NormalizationMethodDescription, refMode = NormalizationMethodDescriptionRef⟩`
- `NormalizationInvariantSetSlot? : ⟨ValueKind = NormalizationInvariant[*], refMode = ByValue⟩`
- `NormalizationMethodInstancePairSlot? : ⟨ValueKind = NormalizationMethodInstanceId[2], refMode = ByValue⟩`  *(used only by `compose`; roles = {inner, outer})*
- `CoordinateValueSlot : ⟨ValueKind = CV, refMode = ByValue⟩`
- `NCVSlot : ⟨ValueKind = NCV, refMode = ByValue⟩`
- `UNMCongruenceSlot : ⟨ValueKind = UNM‑congruence (≡_UNM), refMode = ByValue⟩`
- `NormalizationFixSlot? : ⟨ValueKind = NormalizationFixSpec, refMode = ByValue⟩`

**Authoring note (didactic).** `NormalizationMethodDescriptionSlot`, `NormalizationInvariantSetSlot`, and `NormalizationFixSlot` are typically *resolved/derived* from `CN_Spec.normalization.{method_descriptions,invariants,fix}` plus the selected `NormalizationMethodInstanceId`. They are listed here because they participate in eligibility/audit semantics — not because every operation takes them as explicit inputs.

**Note (transport anchor, not a SlotKind).** When transport/plane reuse is invoked, Audit MUST cite the edition pin key `UNM.TransportRegistryΦ` (aka `UNM.TransportRegistryPhi`) in the editions vector (see Transport/Audit), rather than introducing an ad‑hoc `…Ref` kind.

**OperationAlgebra (conceptual)**
1) `apply`
- Preconditions: `UNM_Eligibility(…) ∈ {pass, degrade}` (fail‑closed; `abstain` ⇒ no NCV output).
- Inputs: `NormalizationMethodInstanceSlot`, `CoordinateValueSlot`, `CharacteristicSpaceSlot`, `CNSpecSlot`, `ContextSlot`
- Outputs: `NCVSlot` (+ availability of `UNMCongruenceSlot` for the same method instance)

2) `compose`
- Purpose: build a composed method (only when explicitly declared lawful).
- Inputs: `NormalizationMethodInstancePairSlot` (roles = {inner, outer}), `ContextSlot`
- Output: `NormalizationMethodInstanceSlot` (new composed `NormalizationMethodInstanceId`), with an explicit validity window and evidence pins.

3) `quotient(≡_UNM)`
- Inputs: `CharacteristicSpaceSlot` (or chart view), `NormalizationMethodInstanceSlot`
- Output: quotient object under `UNMCongruenceSlot`  
  (When a concrete representative is required, `NormalizationFixSlot` (`NormalizationFixSpec`) must be declared and used.)

**LawSet (UNM laws; identifiers are stable)**
- **UNM‑L0 (Values, not characteristics).** UNM produces `NCV` as a **value** under declared invariants; it does not redefine the underlying characteristic meaning (measurement meaning remains owned by A.17/A.18 and evidence by C.16).
- **UNM‑L1 (Declared method class gate).** A normalization method instance is admissible only if its method is declared in the allowed method class set: `{ratio:scale, interval:affine, ordinal:monotone, nominal:categorical, tabular:LUT(+uncertainty)}`.
- **UNM‑L1a (Method semantics live in the method).** `NormalizationMethod` defines invariants, closure (composition / inverses where defined), and validity rules. UNM consumes these declarations; it does not invent “extra” legality.
- **UNM‑L2 (Congruence is first-class).** Each chosen method instance induces `≡_UNM` over charts/views; equality/comparability decisions that rely on normalization are defined on the quotient (or on a declared fix), not on raw labels.
- **UNM‑L2a (Context-local by default).** `≡_UNM` is context‑local; cross‑context reuse requires explicit transport declarations (Bridge-only).
- **UNM‑L3 (Fail‑closed).** If admissibility/evidence is insufficient (or required inputs are missing/stale), UNM does not silently coerce; it yields `abstain` or `degrade` (tri‑state guard discipline) and may surface an explicit freshness/work request (see A.19.UNM:4.5).  
  *Didactic reading:* `abstain` ⇒ no lawful NCV/comparability for this slice; `degrade` ⇒ NCV may be produced but must be treated as policy‑gated and auditable (never “quietly good enough”).
- **UNM‑L4 (No implicit indicatorization).** `NCV` does not imply “indicator”; indicator status is a separate policy step (UINDM).
- **UNM‑L5 (Bridge‑only transport).** Cross‑context reuse of normalization requires explicit Bridge-only transport declarations (Bridge id + channel + `ReferencePlane(src,tgt)`); describedEntity changes require a KindBridge (`CL^k`) and the two‑bridge rule. Penalties route to the **R‑lane only** (never to F/G; if scalarized, into `R_eff`).
- **UNM‑L6 (Time explicitness).** Validity windows are named; no implicit “latest”.
- **UNM‑L7 (Auditability).** The applied method instance, invariants, validity window, evidence pins, and any transport/plane declarations must be auditable as refs/pins.
- **UNM‑L8 (No shadow writers).** When UNM publishes/updates editioned anchors used downstream (e.g., `UNM.TransportRegistryΦ`), other patterns and faces treat them as **ref‑only** (single‑writer discipline; no competing centers of gravity).
- **UNM‑L9 (No publish/telemetry ops).** UNM defines no publish/telemetry step. Any publication/telemetry is out of suite closure and does not mutate UNM semantics (`NCV`, `≡_UNM`, quotient/fix); only Audit pins are produced here.

**AdmissibilityConditions**
Definition (UNM‑Eligibility):
`UNM_Eligibility(NormalizationMethodInstanceSlot, CoordinateValueSlot, CharacteristicSpaceSlot, CNSpecSlot, ContextSlot) → GuardDecision`
where `GuardDecision ∈ {pass | degrade | abstain}` and follows this predicate semantics:
- **pass** iff all of the following hold:
  - (**CN‑frame binding**) the selected `NormalizationMethodInstanceId` is declared in `CN_Spec.normalization.instances` (or an equivalent declared surface), its method kind is included in `CN_Spec.normalization.methods`, and (if present) it satisfies `normalization.admissible_reparameterizations`;
  - (**Target coordinate binding**) the input `CV`’s `slot_id` belongs to the method instance’s declared bound coordinate set;
  - (**Scale‑regime compatibility**) the method kind is compatible with the coordinate’s regime (`ratio:scale | interval:affine | ordinal:monotone | nominal:categorical | tabular:LUT(+uncertainty)`) and preserves the declared `NormalizationInvariant[*]` (from `CN_Spec.normalization.invariants` and/or the method description);
  - (**Validity window**) the method instance’s validity window covers the active slice/time policy (no implicit “latest”);
  - (**Evidence sufficiency when routed into governance**) when `comparability.mode = normalization-based` (or downstream uses `NCV` in gated decisions), the method instance’s evidence pins satisfy `CN_Spec.comparability.minimal_evidence` (structure typically gated by `G.0`; evidence semantics owned by `C.16`).
- **degrade** iff all non‑evidence conditions above hold, but the evidence check does not pass and the declared failure behavior permits producing a policy‑gated degraded `NCV` rather than abstaining.
- **abstain** otherwise (including missing binding, coordinate mismatch, out‑of‑window validity, or evidence failure when the declared failure behavior is abstain).

**Applicability**
UNM is applicable when:
- `CN_Spec.comparability.mode = normalization-based`, or
- a declared downstream step requires “compare-on-invariants” and thus requires explicit normalization.
UNM is typically skipped when `comparability.mode = coordinatewise` (unless an explicit downstream step requires a declared quotient/fix anyway).

**Transport**
- **Bridge-only.** Any cross-context use must be expressed via explicit Bridge pins and recorded in Audit.
- If the describedEntity changes, a KindBridge (`CL^k`) must be declared (two‑bridge rule).
- If transport/plane reuse is invoked, the edition pin key `UNM.TransportRegistryΦ` (aka `UNM.TransportRegistryPhi`) MUST be cited explicitly (in addition to Bridge/CL/ReferencePlane pins); penalties remain R‑lane only.

**Γ_timePolicy**
- Default: `point` (no implicit “latest”).
- If normalization relies on time windows, the validity window is part of the method instance and must be declared.

**PlaneRegime**
- Normalized values live on the episteme ReferencePlane by default.
- Plane crossings require explicit `CL^plane` and are audited; penalties route to `R_eff` only.

**Audit**
Audit records MUST include:
- `CNSpecRef.edition` + `comparability.mode`
- (when present) `CN_Spec.normalization.UNM_id` (the selected UNM mechanism instance id for this CN‑frame)
- chosen `NormalizationMethodInstanceId`, its validity window, and any `NormalizationMethodDescriptionRef.edition`
- declared `NormalizationInvariant[*]` and `NormalizationFixSpec` (if used)
- any declared admissible re‑parameterizations (if present in `CN‑Spec.normalization`)
- all evidence pins (as declared by the instance) and their scope ids
- any Bridge/CL/ReferencePlane pins if transport or plane crossings are invoked, plus the edition pin key `UNM.TransportRegistryΦ/Phi`
- any emitted `FreshnessRequest` / work request identifiers (when applicable; see A.19.UNM:4.5)

#### A.19.UNM:4.2 - CN-frame wiring: `normalization` and comparability routing (normative-by-reference)

**Tell.** CN-frame does not “do normalization”; it **routes** normalization.  
- `comparability.mode ∈ {coordinatewise, normalization-based}` governs whether comparisons are done directly or “normalize-then-compare”.  
- `normalization.UNM_id?` selects the UNM mechanism instance used by this CN-frame.  
- `normalization.methods / instances / method_descriptions / invariants / fix` provide the declared surface that UNM consumes.  
(If present) `normalization.admissible_reparameterizations` constrain which re‑parameterizations count as “admissible” under the declared invariants.  
(See CN-frame definition in `A.19.CN`; `A.19.CN` remains the semantic owner of the CN-frame surface. This section only states the UNM consumption/interpretation constraints and does not introduce a shadow spec.)

#### A.19.UNM:4.3 - Evidence and calibration are owned by MM‑CHR (normative-by-reference)

UNM does not claim “this normalization is legitimate” by decree.  
Instead, legitimacy is routed through evidence carriers and calibration/validity artifacts owned by `C.16 (MM‑CHR)` and referenced from the chosen `NormalizationMethodInstance`.

#### A.19.UNM:4.4 - Didactic rule: quotients or fixes, never “labels” (normative)

When UNM is used to support comparability/acceptance:
- Think in **invariants and equivalence classes** (quotients), not in labels.  
- If a concrete representative is needed, declare a `NormalizationFix` explicitly.  
Do not silently treat an arbitrary representative as canonical.

#### A.19.UNM:4.5 - P2W / TGA integration note (normative-by-reference)

When UNM is used inside transduction flows/graphs (e.g., `E.18 (E.TGA)`):
- UNM occurs **before** selection/decision steps.
- If required measurements are **missing or stale**, UNM does not “guess a number”; it surfaces an explicit **freshness/work request** that must be planned in `U.WorkPlanning` and executed in `U.WorkEnactment`.
- In TGA terms, transport/plane reuse is surfaced as explicit calibration/transport artifacts pinned to `TransportRegistry^Φ` (editioned as `UNM.TransportRegistryΦ`; penalties stay R‑lane only).
- Editioned anchors referenced by faces downstream (e.g., `UNM.TransportRegistryΦ`, and legality anchors when applicable) remain **single‑writer**: downstream consumers cite them as refs and do not re‑author them.

### A.19.UNM:5 - Archetypal Grounding (Tell–Show–Show)

**Tell.** UNM is the conceptual “front gate” that turns “raw coordinate values” into “values comparable under declared invariants”, by:
1) choosing an admissible normalization method instance (with evidence and validity window),  
2) applying it to produce NCVs,  
3) exposing `≡_UNM` and (optionally) quotient/fix structure so downstream mechanisms can remain lawful and explicit.

**Show (System).** A team compares alternatives using `normalization-based` comparability:
- CN-Spec declares:
  - `comparability.mode = normalization-based`
  - `normalization.invariants = {unit-alignment, polarity}`
  - a method instance `M_unitScale` with validity window `VW_2026Q1` and evidence pins.
- UNM applies `M_unitScale` to each coordinate value, producing NCVs.
- CPM compares the NCV-profiles (not raw profiles).
- If evidence pins are missing for a slice, UNM returns `GuardDecision = abstain`, preventing “fake comparability”.

**Show (Episteme).** Quotient thinking:
- Two chart items `x` and `y` are different raw values (different units or reference planes).
- Under a chosen normalization method instance, `x ≡_UNM y` holds.
- Comparability claims are made over `[x]_{≡_UNM}` and `[y]_{≡_UNM}` (equivalence classes).
- If reporting needs a single representative, a declared `NormalizationFix` selects it; otherwise, do not pretend a representative is canonical.

**Show (P2W / TGA).** Missing/stale inputs:
- A selector (or comparator) requires comparability under `normalization-based` mode.
- UNM finds that a required coordinate value is missing/stale for the current slice and the instance validity window.
- UNM returns `GuardDecision = abstain` (fail‑closed) **and** emits a `FreshnessRequest` that must be handled via planned baseline + enactment (UNM does not silently proceed).

### A.19.UNM:6 - Bias‑Annotation

Common cognitive traps around normalization:
- **Normalization-as-truth bias:** treating NCVs as “objective” instead of “objective under declared invariants and validity window”.
- **Hidden-steps bias:** assuming normalization “happened somewhere” and skipping explicit routing/pins.
- **Unit-blindness:** treating numeric sameness as semantic sameness.
- **Proxy legitimacy:** assuming a popular method is legitimate without evidence pins or validity region.

Mitigation: enforce explicit `NormalizationMethodInstance` + validity window + evidence pins; and keep `≡_UNM`/quotient semantics explicit.

### A.19.UNM:7 - Conformance Checklist

- [ ] **Template compliance:** canonical E.8 sections 1–13 present in order; pattern ends with `### A.19.UNM:End`.
- [ ] **Terminology:** uses `NormalizationMethodId`, `NormalizationMethodInstanceId`, `NormalizationMethodDescription(Ref)`, `CV`, `NCV`, `≡_UNM`, `NormalizationInvariant[*]`, `NormalizationFixSpec`; avoids “map” wording (esp. `Map`); κ‑notation is retired.
- [ ] **CN routing:** uses `CN_Spec.comparability.mode` and the `CN_Spec.normalization` surface; does not embed “shadow CN-spec”.
- [ ] **Fail-closed:** eligibility is tri-state and never coerces unknown to pass.
- [ ] **Legality classes declared:** method class is one of `{ratio:scale, interval:affine, ordinal:monotone, nominal:categorical, tabular:LUT(+uncertainty)}` and the instance’s validity window is named.
- [ ] **No indicator conflation:** does not treat NCV as automatically implying indicator status.
- [ ] **Transport discipline:** cross-context/plane reuse is Bridge-only, explicit, audited; penalties route to `R`/`R_eff` only.
- [ ] **Quotient/fix discipline:** if a representative is required, `NormalizationFix` is declared; otherwise quotient semantics remain abstract.
- [ ] **Auditability:** method instance, validity window, evidence pins, and transport/plane policies are recorded as refs/pins.
- [ ] **No shadow writers:** if editioned transport/calibration anchors are used (e.g., `UNM.TransportRegistryΦ`), downstream consumers treat them as ref‑only (single‑writer discipline).
- [ ] **P2W awareness (when used in flows):** missing/stale inputs lead to explicit `FreshnessRequest` emissions (planned via P2W), not silent coercion.
- [ ] **SlotKind discipline:** SlotKind tokens reuse the CHR SlotKind lexicon where applicable; UNM‑specific SlotKinds are docked into the suite lexicon before use (no ad‑hoc drift).
- [ ] **TransportRegistry key discipline:** `UNM.TransportRegistryΦ` (alias `UNM.TransportRegistryPhi`) is referenced as an edition pin key (and audited) / `TransportRegistry^Φ` in TGA terms, not introduced as a new `…Ref` kind.

### A.19.UNM:8 - Common Anti‑Patterns and How to Avoid Them

1) **Hidden normalization inside scoring or selection**  
   Avoid by routing via `CN_Spec.comparability.mode` and explicit UNM use.

2) **“NCV ⇒ indicator” shortcut**  
   Avoid by treating indicatorization as UINDM policy, not a byproduct of normalization.

3) **“We normalized” without declaring invariants**  
   Avoid by naming `NormalizationInvariant[*]` and exposing `≡_UNM`.

4) **Cross-context reuse without transport declaration**  
   Avoid by Bridge-only transport and auditing Bridge/CL/ReferencePlane pins.

5) **Choosing a representative implicitly**  
   Avoid by either keeping quotient objects abstract or declaring `NormalizationFix`.

6) **Using “map/mapping/Map” language as if it were harmless**  
   Avoid by using “normalization / re‑parameterization under invariants” and by keeping `Map` for its specialized FPF meaning.

7) **Treating UNM outputs as globally comparable across contexts/planes**  
   Avoid by Bridge-only transport declarations + audited ReferencePlane/CL pins; otherwise stay context-local and fail‑closed.

8) **Re‑authoring editioned transport/calibration anchors downstream**  
   Avoid by treating `UNM.TransportRegistryΦ` (and similar anchors) as single‑writer artifacts: downstream is ref‑only.

### A.19.UNM:9 - Consequences

**Benefits**
- Makes “normalize-then-compare” a first-class governance choice.
- Centralizes semantic ownership, improving usability and reducing drift.
- Supports evolvability: method families can evolve via packs/extensions without mutating the mechanism surface.
- Prevents silent illegality (unit/scale/plane errors) by fail-closed guards.

**Costs**
- Requires explicit declarations (method instance, invariants, validity window, evidence pins).
- Some workflows must learn quotient/fix thinking (a conceptual overhead).

### A.19.UNM:10 - Rationale

UNM is designed as a **minimal canonical semantic surface**:
- Enough structure to prevent illegal comparisons and hidden transformations.
- Explicit routing in CN-frame so normalization is governance, not an algorithmic trick.
- Evidence/calibration are delegated to MM‑CHR to avoid redefining measurement meaning.
- Bridge-only transport prevents accidental “global normalization” across contexts.

This balances evolvability (methods evolve) with didactic usability (one place to read what UNM is).

### A.19.UNM:11 - SoTA‑Echoing (post‑2015 practice alignment)

UNM does not prescribe algorithms, but it is designed to **host** SoTA normalization families via `NormalizationMethodDescriptionRef` + evidence pins (typically shipped as `G.2` SoTA packs and wired via `GPatternExtension` modules, not as mutations of UNM’s surface). Examples of post‑2015 method families that often appear as evidence-backed normalization candidates (domain-dependent):
- **SoTA ≠ popular.** Method families enter UNM through `G.2` claim structures + edition pins + evidence pins; “widely used” is not a validity claim by itself.
- **Calibration of probabilistic coordinates** (e.g., temperature scaling; multiclass calibration families such as Dirichlet calibration).  
  *Typical citations:* Guo et al., 2017; Kull et al., 2019.
- **Shift-/validity-region-aware normalization** where “validity window/region” is explicit and shift detection enters as *evidence*, not as hidden branching.  
  *Typical citations:* Lipton et al., 2018 (shift estimation); Ovadia et al., 2019 (uncertainty under shift) — as evidence motifs.
- **Order-preserving transforms** for ordinal regimes (normalization constrained to monotone transforms; legality forbids arithmetic).  
  *Typical citations:* modern monotonic modeling toolkits (post‑2017) used as *method families*, not as silent arithmetic.
- **Set-valued / uncertainty-aware normalization outputs** where uncertainty is preserved as a first-class outcome (tri‑state guards + set-valued artifacts, rather than coerced point values).  
  *Typical citations:* conformal-style families (post‑2018+) used as evidence/uncertainty carriers.

SoTA is connected as **wiring** (packs/extensions) while UNM’s surface remains stable.
