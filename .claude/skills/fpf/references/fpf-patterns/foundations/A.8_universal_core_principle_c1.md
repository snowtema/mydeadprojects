## A.8 - Universal Core Principle (C‑1)

*“A principle that works in only one world is local folklore; a first principle architects every world.”*

### A.8:1 - Problem Frame

FPF aspires to be an **operating system for thought** that engineers, biologists, economists, and AI agents can all use without translation layers. That promise rests on the **universality** of its core primitives (`U.Type`s).  History is littered with “upper ontologies” that proclaimed universality yet smuggled in the biases of a single discipline; once deployed beyond their birthplace, they cracked or ballooned.  Rule C‑1 turns “universal” from a marketing word into a measurable criterion: *cross‑domain congruence*.


### A.8:2 - Problem

| Pathology                 | Manifestation                                                                                       |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Parochial Drift**       | A “universal” `U.Resource` works for ERP bills of materials but collapses for ATP in cell biology.  |
| **Alienated Communities** | Subject‑matter experts recognise the bias and abandon the framework, fracturing knowledge silos.    |
| **Kernel Bloat**          | Competing “almost‑universal” types are added to patch gaps, violating Ontological Parsimony (A 11). |


### A.8:3 - Forces

| Force                           | Tension                                                                              |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Generality vs Specificity**   | Primitives must stretch across physics ↔ social science yet keep actionable meaning. |
| **Rigor vs Pragmatism**         | Proof of universality must be checkable, not philosophical hand‑waving.              |
| **Inclusivity vs Coherence**    | Welcoming new ideas should not swamp the kernel with domain jargon.                  |
| **Cognitive Load vs Grounding** | Examples help readers, but too many examples obscure the essence.                    |


### A.8:4 - Solution — *The Three‑Domain Falsification Test*

> **Normative Rule (C‑1)** A `U.Type` **enters the kernel only if** it is shown to play the **same Role** in **at least three foundationally distinct domains**.

 **Heterogeneity & QD‑triad guarantee (C‑1.QD).**
 In addition to distinct **domain‑families** (choose from: *Exact Sciences - Natural Sciences - Engineering & Technology - Formal Sciences - Social & Behavioural Sciences*), the **triad** SHALL demonstrate **quality diversity**:
(a) **Hetero‑test.** Each projection adds at least one non‑trivial **DescriptorMap** signal or Bridge path not subsumed by the other two (no aliasing by mere renaming).
(b) **QD evidence.** Publish **Creativity‑CHR / NQD‑CAL** evidence for the triad: `Diversity_P` (set‑level) and its **IlluminationSummary** telemetry metric with ≥3 non‑empty cells and `occupancyEntropy > 0` under the declared grid.
(c) **Policy disclosure.** Declare the Context‑local `QD_policy` (binning/grid, kernel, time‑window) used to compute the telemetry metrics.
(References: **C.17** `Diversity_P` & illumination Summary as telemetry metric; **C.18** `U.DescriptorMap`, `U.IlluminationSummary`.)

Implementation steps (Domain Families): 

1. source domain‑families from the active F1‑Card (taxonomyRef/embeddingRef edition). The five coarse families {Exact, Natural & Life, Engineering & Tech, Formal, Social & Behavioural} are informative only; if used for pedagogy, publish an explicit mapping to the F1‑Card taxonomy. The triad gate is measured by MinInterFamilyDistance ≥ δ_family (per F1‑Card), not by labels alone.

2. **Role‑Projection Records** For each domain, author a short **`Role‑Projection`** tuple: `{domain, indigenous term, Role, exemplar}`.
   *Example:* `{physics, "Free Energy", extremum driver, closed gas system}`.

3. **Congruence Check** All three exemplars must satisfy the **same abstract intent**; superficial analogy is rejected.

4. **Living Index** Track the ratio

   $$
     U\text{-Index}=\frac{\text{\# kernel types lacking 3 projections}}{\text{\# kernel types}}
   $$

   as a health signal; target ≤ 0.05 (not a bureaucratic gate).

*Rule of thumb for busy managers:* “**One idea, three worlds.** If you can’t point to the trio, park it in a Extention Pattern.”


### A.8:5 - Archetypal Grounding (System / Episteme)

| Universal `U.Type` | **Domain 1 - Physics**                  | **Domain 2 - Life Sci.**            | **Domain 3 - Tech & Soc.**       | Congruent Role                |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `U.Objective`      | *Free Energy* minimum in thermodynamics | *Fitness* maximisation in evolution | *Loss* minimisation in ML        | Extremum driver of change     |
| `U.System`         | Thermodynamic control volume            | Biological organism (cell membrane) | Cyber‑physical system (IoT edge) | Bounded interacting whole     |
| `U.Resource`       | Joules of energy                        | ATP molecules                       | Budget dollars                   | Conserved, spendable quantity |

These juxtapositions give engineer‑managers an immediate sense of *why* each primitive is worth learning.

### A.8:6 - Conformance Checklist

| ID          | Requirement                                                                                                                            | Purpose                                                 |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CC‑UC 1** | A proposed `U.Type` **SHALL** include ≥ 3 Role‑Projection records, each taken from a *different* domain family.                        | Enforces the Three‑Domain Test.                         |
| **CC‑UC 2** | Each Role‑Projection **MUST** explain in ≤ 30 words how the domain notion fulfils the *same Role* as the proposed `U.Type`. | Blocks superficial analogies.                           |
| **CC‑UC 3** | No single artefact may serve as exemplar for more than one domain projection.                                                          | Prevents contrived “triple duty” examples.              |
| **CC‑UC 4** | A **specialised** `U.SubType` inherits its parent’s projections **and** adds ≥ 1 new domain projection, never fewer.                   | Keeps refinements as universal as their parents.        |
| **CC‑UC 5** | While the U‑Index > 0.05, authors **SHALL** prioritise supplying missing projections over adding new core concepts.                    | Maintains kernel health without procedural bureaucracy. |
| **CC‑UC‑2‑QD‑triad.** | The three Role‑Projections come from **different domain‑families** AND the triad PUBLISHES: `{FamilyCoverage, MinInterFamilyDistance, Diversity_P, IlluminationSummary}` with `MinInterFamilyDistance ≥ δ_family` (per **F1‑Card** DistanceDef & edition). + Provenance MUST cite `DescriptorMapRef` (incl. `DistanceDef`/edition), `F1‑Card id+edition`, and the grid/binning policy used for `IlluminationSummary`.  | quality diversity of domains

### A.8:7 - Consequences

| Benefit                                                                                                    | Trade‑off                                     | Mitigation                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Lean, trusted kernel** – every primitive earns its place by real work in three worlds.                   | Authoring effort for projections.             | Patterns A 5/A 6 provide templates and exemplar libraries. |
| **Cross‑disciplinary uptake** – physicists, managers, and biologists see their own language reflected.     | Some novel ideas wait to gather evidence.     | They live safely in Extention Patterns until mature.                 |
| **Resilience to domain drift** – if one field’s jargon changes, the other two anchors preserve continuity. | Possible oversimplification of niche nuances. | Domain‑specific elaborations belong in FPF patterns.      |


### A.8:8 - Rationale

Deep research over the last decade shows *structural homologies* across domains:

* Free‑energy minimisation ↔ negative log‑likelihood ↔ Bayesian surprise (Friston 2023).
* Conservation laws in physics mirror budget balancing in economics (Rayo 2024).

By demanding three independent manifestations, FPF captures these convergences *without privileging* any single vocabulary.  The principle operationalises **Popperian falsifiability** for universality: a concept that cannot survive a three‑domain cross‑examination is, by definition, not a first principle.  This guards Pillars **P‑1 (Cognitive Elegance)** and **P‑4 (Open‑Ended Kernel)** simultaneously.


### A.8:9 - Relations

| Relation             | Linked Pattern                       | Contribution                                                          |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Supports**         | A 11 Ontological Parsimony           | Filters candidates before sunset reviews.                             |
| **Prerequisite for** | A 9 Cross‑Scale Consistency          | Only universal types can propagate invariants up and down holarchies. |
| **Complementary**    | A 7 Strict Distinction               | Together provide clarity (A 7) and breadth (A 8).                     |
| **Enables**          | B 1 Universal Algebra of Aggregation | Γ‑operators rely on domain‑agnostic operands.                         |


### A.8:10 - Known Uses

* **Energy ↔ Budget ↔ Attention** – Engineering teams reused `U.Resource` to reason about battery charge, project funds, and user‑attention minutes with one algebra, cutting integration effort by half (2024 pilot).
* **Objective unification** – An AI lab mapped *loss functions*, a bio‑lab mapped *Darwinian fitness*, and a factory mapped *scrap‑rate* all to `U.Objective`, enabling shared optimisation tooling.

These cases validated that the Three‑Domain Test is achievable in practice, not theoretical paperwork.


### A.8:11 - Open Questions

1. **Domain taxonomy stability** – Should the five domain families be versioned as science evolves (e.g., quantum‑bio‑tech)?
2. **Automated congruence checks** – Can category‑theoretic tooling semi‑automate the functional‑role equivalence test?
3. **Edge‑case hybrids** – How are bio‑cyber‑physical chimera systems counted: a new domain or a composite projection?
