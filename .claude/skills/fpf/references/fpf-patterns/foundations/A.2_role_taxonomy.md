## A.2 - Role Taxonomy
> **Type:** Architectural (A)
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative

*A holon’s essence tells us **what it is**; its roles tell us **what it is being, here and now**.*

### A.2:1 - Problem frame

Pattern A.1 established the **substantial** characteristic of the core (`Entity → Holon → {System, Episteme, …}`), cleanly separating identity from structure and aggregation. The present pattern introduces the **functional** characteristic: how a holon participates in purposes **within a bounded context** and for some interval. This extends the early sketch of A.2 and tightens its alignment with A.7 (Strict Distinction): roles are *not* parts and *not* behaviours; they are contextual **masks** that a holon wears while behaviours are handled by **Method**/**Work**. 

### A.2:2 - Problem

Without an explicit role calculus:

1. **Type explosion & conflation.** Each new purpose breeds a new “subtype” (`PumpAsCoolingLoop`, `PumpAsFuelLoop`, …), violating parsimony and fusing substance with function.
2. **Agency opacity.** It becomes unclear whether *any* system may act as a transformer/agent, or only pre-declared special kinds.
3. **Epistemic blindness.** Knowledge artefacts (papers, proofs) cannot be given roles, blocking modelling of citation, evidence, or design-time justification.

### A.2:3 - Forces

| Force                                | Tension                                                              |   |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | - |
| **Identity vs Function**             | A holon’s make‑up ↔ its transient, contextual purpose.               |   |
| **Static vs Dynamic classification** | Fixed type lattice ↔ late‑binding of new roles.                      |   |
| **Universality vs Familiarity**      | One mechanism for pumps **and** papers ↔ domain‑specific role names. |   |
| **Simplicity vs Expressiveness**     | Minimal primitives ↔ multi‑role, multi‑holder scenarios.             |   |

### A.2:4 - Solution

We elevate **Role** to a first‑class semantic construct: a context‑bound *mask* (capability/obligation schema) worn by a holon. **Behaviour** and **resource deltas** live in **Method**/**Work**, not in the role itself.

#### A.2:4.1 - S‑level definitions (normative)

* **`U.Role`** — a **context-bound** capability/obligation schema that a holon **may bear (play)** for a time interval. A role has **no parts** and **no resource deltas** of its own. *(A7 guard)*
* **`U.RoleAssignment`** — a first-class assignment record recording that a holon **bears (plays)** a role **in** a bounded context over an optional **Window**. Keep the signature aligned with **A.2.1 Role Assignment Standard**; governance metadata (authority/justification/provenance) is captured via `U.RoleAssigning` and the evidence graph (A.10).

```
U.RoleAssignment {
  holder        : U.Holon,
  role          : U.Role,
  context       : U.BoundedContext,
  window? : U.Window
  justification?: U.Episteme,  // why (standard, SOP, evidence)
  provenance?   : U.Method     // how assignment/verification was done
}
```

Short form (readable): `Holder#Role:Context@Window`.

> **Why a first-class assignment record?** It keeps identity (holon), function (role), context (semantics), and time (run-window) separate yet linked, preventing the substance/function conflation identified above. The early `playsRoleOf(Holon, Role, span)` relation in the draft is subsumed by `U.RoleAssignment` and extended with **Context** (and optional governance fields).

#### A.2:4.2 - Temporal & behavioural alignment

* **MethodDescription** persists as Episteme. A Role **binds** to Method (design‑time), and Work **performs** Method under that Role (run‑time). This preserves the *role ≠ behaviour* split and the *design ↔ run* duality.
* Only **Work** carries resource deltas (feeds Γ\_work); a Role never does.

#### A.2:4.3 - Admissibility constraints (concept-level; non-deontic).

1. **Locality.** `role ∈ Roles(context)`. Outside its context, a role’s meaning is undefined.
2. **Non‑mereological.** No Role (nor Method/MethodDescription) may appear in any `partOf` chain; holarchies are for substantial holons only.
3. **Multiplicity.** A holder may **bear** multiple roles concurrently; a role may be **borne** by many holders—subject to each context’s compatibility rules.
4. **Time anchoring.** `timespan` (if present) is non-empty and finite for run-time claims; design-time assignments are timeless but versioned via `MethodDescription` identity.
5. **Behavioural coherence.** For any `U.Work` window, the performer plays the Role that binds the executed Method. *(No hidden role swaps.)*

#### A.2:4.4 - Taxonomic frame (within a context)

Within each `U.BoundedContext`, role names are organised as a **partial order** (refinements) plus an **incompatibility** relation (mutually exclusive roles). Typical **substrate‑neutral** anchors:

| Kernel Role       | Intent                                | System archetype              | Episteme archetype                       |   |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | - |
| `TransformerRole` | Changes other holons via Method/Work. | Robot arm assembling casings. | Prover constructing a new lemma.         |   |
| `ObserverRole`    | Collects evidence / metrics.          | Sensor array on a test‑rig.   | Reviewer annotating an article.          |   |
| `SupervisorRole`  | Governs subordinate holons.           | PLC orchestrating a line.     | Meta‑analysis curator combining studies. |   |

> Domains refine these anchors: e.g., `CoolingCirculatorRole`, `CitationSourceRole`, `LemmaRole`.

### A.2:5 - Archetypal Grounding (Tell–Show–Show: System / Episteme)

**Tell.** A single holon can be the *same bearer* across time while taking on different, context‑bound roles. A role is a *mask* (capability/obligation schema) that explains *what it is being* in a given `U.BoundedContext`; behavioural facts and resource deltas remain in `U.Method` / `U.Work`.

**Show.**

**System case — Cooling loop**
`PumpUnit#3#HydraulicPump:Plant‑A`
`HydraulicPump ↦binds↦ ChannelFluid` (design)
`run‑2025‑08‑08 isExecutionOf centrifugal_pump_curve.ld` and `performedBy PumpUnit#3` (run)
*(All behavioural/resource facts live in Work; the Role is the mask.)*

**Episteme case — Standard in design**
`RFC‑9110.pdf#ProtocolStandard:WorldWideWeb` justifies `MethodDescription` selection; the **system** bearing `TransformerRole` is the design service that executed the selection work. The episteme did **not** act.

**Collective vs set (safety pitfall)**
A **set** `{Alice, Bob, 3.14}` has no behaviour; a **team** is a **system** with boundary, coordination **Method**, and supervision **Work**; only the latter can bear agentic roles.

### A.2:6 - Bias-Annotation

Lenses tested: **Arch**, **Onto/Epist**, **Prag**, **Did**. Scope: **Universal** (A‑cluster).

* **Architecture bias (Arch):** treating roles as structural parts can smuggle function into mereology and break holarchies.

* *Mitigation:* keep `partOf` chains role‑free; roles are not constituents (see CC‑A2.1).
  +* **Onto/Epist bias (Onto/Epist):** anthropomorphising epistemes collapses evidence into agency.
* *Mitigation:* epistemes can justify/authorize; only systems perform methods and work (CC‑A2.2).
  +* **Pragmatic bias (Prag):** over‑contextualising can fragment reuse and create naming drift.
* *Mitigation:* require explicit `:Context` binding and explicit bridges instead of silent equivalence (CC‑A2.4).
  +* **Didactic bias (Did):** metaphors (“mask”) may be misread as informal.
* *Mitigation:* bind obligations to CC items; avoid imperative prose outside CC.

### A.2:7 - Authoring guidance (for engineers and leads)

* **Name roles for intent, not mechanics.** Prefer `CoolingCirculatorRole` over `ChannelFluidWithCentrifugalProfile`.
* **Pin the context early.** If two teams disagree, split contexts and (optionally) define an alignment bridge; do not over‑generalise the role.
* **Document the enactment chain.** For any operational claim, be ready to point to: `RoleAssigning → Method ↔ MethodDescription → Work`. (Readers’ dictionary: *BPMN workflow → MethodDescription; operation/job → Work.*)

### A.2:9 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

1. **“Transformer as system subtype.”**
   ✗ *“`U.TransformerSystem` builds pumps.”*
   ✓ *“`RobotArm R‑45#Transformer:Plant‑A` executed Work W.”* (Role is a mask; behaviour is Method/Work.)

2. **“Role as part.”**
   ✗ *“The pump’s role is one of its components.”*
   ✓ Roles are **never** parts; components are substantial. Keep all `partOf` chains role‑free.

3. **“Episteme acts by itself.”**
   ✗ *“The PDF enforced the SOP.”*
   ✓ An **episteme** can hold roles like `ProtocolStandard` **in context**, but only a **system** performs the Method/Work that uses it.

4. **“Context leakage.”**
   ✗ *“Pluto is Planet and DwarfPlanet.”* (in one tacit space)
   ✓ *“`Pluto#Planet:Early20thCenturyAstronomy`; `Pluto#DwarfPlanet:IAU_2006_Definition`.”* No contradiction—different bounded contexts. (Illustrative of `U.RoleAssignment` semantics carried forward from the A.2.1.)


### A.2:10 - Consequences

| Benefit                     | Why it matters                                                                                                       | Trade‑off / Mitigation                                                                       |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Category‑error immunity** | Clear firewall between **identity** (holarchies) and **function** (roles) prevents mixing “parts” with “masks”.      | Slight modelling overhead; templates provide checklists (A.7, A.14).                         |
| **Operational clarity**     | Who does what, when, and under which mask becomes audit‑ready (`performedBy ⊆ playsRoleOf`).                         | Requires spans on Role assignments; mitigated by default “open‑ended” spans in drafts.          |
| **Epistemic hygiene**       | Knowledge holons contribute as **evidence** or **constraints**, never as doers.                                      | Authors must rewrite anthropomorphic prose; canonical rewrites help.                         |
| **Cross-context pluralism** | Same bearer can hold different roles across contexts without contradiction; differences are explicit in the assignment. | Requires declaring the **bounded context**; E.10 eases the ceremony with registers/aliases.  |
| **Γ‑coherence**             | Order/time/aggregation stay in Γ‑operators, not overloaded into “role" edges.                                        | Authors learn when to call Γ\_ctx/Γ\_time; the Part B on‑ramp is short.                      |

### A.2:11 - Rationale (post‑2015 cross‑domain corroboration)

*Why insist on roles as contextual masks and externalised transformers?*

1. **Constructor Theory (2015–2022).** Post‑2015 work by Deutsch & Marletto re‑centres physics on **possible tasks and constructors** rather than objects, mirroring FPF’s **TransformerRole**: behaviour is attached to “who can realise a task,” not to substance per se. Our separation of **SubstantialHolon** vs **Role** and the insistence on **external** transformers directly echo this shift. *(Conceptual alignment noted in A.2 Solution and A.12 intent.)* 
2. **Layered Control Architectures (Matni–Ames–Doyle, 2024).** The modern control stack cleanly **externalises** regulators and planners relative to plants. FPF’s obligatory “system bearing TransformerRole” (A.7, A.12) is isomorphic to that separation, keeping supervision and actuation **outside** the controlled holon. 
3. **Active‑Inference / Agency spectrum (2017–2023).** Contemporary models treat agency as **graded** and **contextual** (percept‑act loops tuned by free‑energy bounds). A.13 adopts exactly this: **AgentialRole** is a role worn by a holon, with graded measurements via **Agency‑CHR**, not a static type.
4. **Basal Cognition & multi‑scale organisation (2019–2024).** Fields & Levin argue for **cross‑scale** control and information flows; FPF encodes this via Γ‑flavours and the **Meta‑Holon Transition** triggers, ensuring Role assignments compose across scales without collapsing identity into function.
5. **Knowledge ecosystems & safety cases (2018–2025).** Modern assurance relies on **traceable evidence** and conservative integration (no “truth averaging”): our A.10 anchors (SCR/RSCR) and Γ\_epist’s **weakest‑link** fold implement that discipline and forbid self‑evidence. 

> Summing up: post‑2015 science and engineering converge on **roles as contextual capabilities**, **externalised control**, and **traceable evidence**. A.2 codifies these insights in a substrate‑neutral way, keeping the Core small yet powerful.

### A.2:12 - SoTA-Echoing (post‑2015 alignment, informative)

| Claim (A.2 need) | SoTA practice (post‑2015) | Primary source (post‑2015) | Alignment with A.2 | Adoption status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Roles are context‑dependent, anti‑rigid descriptors rather than structural parts. | Conceptual modeling distinguishes substantial types from role types; roles depend on context/relational situations. | Guizzardi (2019), *Ontological Foundations for Conceptual Modeling*; recent OntoUML/UFO literature. | Maps to `U.Role` as context‑bound schema; keeps `partOf` free of roles. | **Adopt.** |
| Meaning boundaries must be explicit; reuse across boundaries must be declared, not assumed. | Modern DDD and socio‑technical architecture emphasise explicit bounded contexts and explicit translation/alignment. | Vernon (2016), *Domain‑Driven Design Distilled*; Newman (2021), *Building Microservices*. | Matches `role ∈ Roles(context)` and CC‑A2.4 context binding + explicit bridge discipline. | **Adopt/Adapt.** Adopt boundaries; adapt reuse via FPF Bridges + CL. |
| Agency should not be attributed to artifacts; treat evidence/provenance as first‑class. | Safety/assurance and governance treat documents as evidence and constraints; provenance is required for claims. | ISO 26262:2018; NIST SP 800‑53 Rev. 5 (2020). | Supports “episteme as justification” and CC‑A2.2/CC‑A2.9 evidence binding. | **Adopt.** |
| “Agency” is graded and mediated by active systems + policies. | Cognitive/agentic modeling treats agency as spectrum, mediated by control loops and policies. | Friston et al. (2017), Active Inference; basal cognition surveys (2018+). | Supports separating role labels from behavioural work; aligns with A.13/A.15. | **Adopt (with scope).** Keep obligations in CC. |

  **A.13 Agential Role & Agency Spectrum** (behavioural roles over systems; graded agency), **A.15 Role–Method–Work Alignment** (bindsMethod / isExecutionOf discipline). 
* **Constrains / Used by B‑cluster:**
  **B.1 Universal Algebra of Aggregation (Γ)** (keep order/time in Γ\_ctx/Γ\_time; keep provenance in Γ\_epist), **B.2 Meta‑Holon Transition** (promotion when supervision/closure appears), **B.3 Trust & Assurance** (evidence & congruence).  
* **Interlocks with E‑cluster (governance & language):**
  **E.10 Lexical Discipline** (registers, tier disambiguation, local aliases like “Transformer”), **E.5.1 DevOps Lexical Firewall** (ban tooling tokens in Core patterns). 
* **Reinforces:**
  **A.10 Evidence Graph Referring** (external transformer; SCR/RSCR), **A.12 External Transformer Principle** (agent externalisation).
