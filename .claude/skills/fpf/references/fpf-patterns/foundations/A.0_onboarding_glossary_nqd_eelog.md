## A.0 - Onboarding Glossary (NQD & E/E‑LOG)
**One‑screen purpose (manager‑first).** This pattern gives newcomers a plain‑language starter kit for FPF’s *generative* engine so they can run a lawful **problem‑solving / search loop** on day one. It explains the few terms you must publish when you **generate, select, and ship portfolios** (not single “winners”), and points to the formal anchors you’ll use later. *(OEE is a Pillar; NQD/E/E‑LOG are the engine parts.)*

**Builds on.** E.2 (**P‑10 Open‑Ended Evolution; P‑2 Didactic Primacy**), A.5, C.17–C.19 - **Coordinates with.** E.7, E.8, E.10; F.17 (UTS); G.5, G.9–G.12 - **Constrains.** Any pattern/UTS row that **describes a generator, selector, or portfolio**.

**Keywords & queries.** *novelty, quality‑diversity (NQD), explore/exploit (E/E‑LOG), **portfolio (set)**, illumination map *(report‑only telemetry)*, parity run, comparability, ReferencePlane, CL^plane, **ParetoOnly** default*

### 1) Problem frame

Engineer‑managers meeting FPF for the first time need a **plain, on‑ramp vocabulary** for the framework’s *generative* engine so they can run an informed **problem‑solving/search loop** on day one—*before* formal specifications. Without that, Part G and Part F read as assurance/alignment only, and teams default to single “best” options. This **undercuts P‑10 Open‑Ended Evolution** and weakens adoption. 

### 2) Problem

In current practice:

* **Single‑winner bias.** Teams look for “the best” option and publish a leaderboard, suppressing **coverage & diversity** signals essential to search.
* **Metric confusion.** “Novelty” and “quality” are used informally; units/scales are omitted; ordinal values are averaged, breaking comparability.
* **Hidden policies.** Explore/exploit budgets and governor rules are implicit; results are irreproducible and **refresh‑unsafe** (no edition/policy pins).
* **Tool lock‑in.** Implementation terms (pipelines, file formats) leak into the Core, violating Guard‑Rails.

FPF needs a **short, normative glossary** that names the generative primitives in **Plain** register and ties each to its **formal anchor**—so portfolios, not single scores, become the default publication. 

### 3) Forces

| Force                         | Tension                                                                         |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Readability vs Rigor**      | One‑liners for managers ↔ lawful definitions with editions and scale types.     |
| **Creativity vs Assurance**   | Open‑ended search (OEE/QD) ↔ conformance, parity, and publication discipline.   |
| **Comparability vs Locality** | Shared N‑U‑C‑D terms ↔ context‑local CG‑frames and bridges with CL.             |
| **Tool‑agnostic Core**        | Conceptual publication in UTS ↔ engineering teams’ urge to cite specific tools. |

### 4) Solution — **Normative onboarding glossary and publication hooks**

#### 4.1 Plain one‑liners (normative on‑ramp; formal anchors in C.17–C.19)

| Term                      | Plain definition (on‑ramp)                                                                                                                                   | See        |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- |
| **Novelty (N)**           | *How unlike the known set in your declared **CharacteristicSpace**. **Compute lawfully** (declared `DescriptorMapRef` + `DistanceDefRef`; no ad‑hoc normalisation). | C.17, C.18 |
| **Use‑Value (U / ValueGain)** | *What it helps you achieve now under your **CG‑Frame**; tie to acceptance/tests; **publish units, scale kind, polarity, ReferencePlane**.                   | C.17, C.18 |
| **Constraint‑Fit (C)**    | *Satisfies must‑constraints (Resource/Risk/Ethics)*; legality via **CG‑Spec**; **unknowns propagate** (never coerce to zero).                                | C.18, G.4  |
| **Diversity_P (portfolio)** | *Adds a new niche to the **portfolio**; measured against the **active archive/grid**, not a single list; declare **ReferencePlane** for each head.          | C.17, C.18 |
| **E/E‑LOG**               | *Named, versioned **explore↔exploit** policy*; governs when to widen space vs refine candidates; **policy‑id is published**.                                   | C.19       |
| **ReferencePlane**        | *Where a value lives:* **world** (system), **concept** (definition), **episteme** (about a claim). **Plane‑crossings add CL^plane** (penalties to **R only**); cite policy‑id. | F.9, G.6   |
| **Scale Variables (S)**  | *The **monotone knobs** along which improvement is expected* (e.g., parameterisation breadth, data exposure, iteration budget, resolution). **Declare S** for any generator/selector claimed to scale. | C.18.1       |
| **Scale Elasticity (χ)** | *Qualitative class of improvement when moving along S* (e.g., **rising**, **knee**, **flat** in the declared window). Used as a **selection lens**; numeric laws live in domain contexts.              | C.18.1       |
| **BLP (Bitter‑Lesson Preference)**  | *Default policy that **prefers general, scale‑amenable methods** over domain‑specific heuristics, unless forbidden by deontics or overturned by a scale‑probe.*                                        | C.19.1, C.24 |
| **Iso‑Scale Parity**  | *Fair comparison across candidates at equalised **scale budgets** along S*; may also include **scale‑probes** (two points) to test elasticity.                                                         | G.9, C.18.1  |

*(Registers & forbidden forms per **LEX‑BUNDLE**; avoid “axis/dimension/validity/process” for measurement and scope.)*  

#### 4.2 Publication & telemetry duties (where these terms **show up**)

1. **UTS surface (Part F).** When a **UTS row describes a generator, selector, or portfolio**, it **MUST** surface **N, U, C, Diversity_P, E/E‑LOG `policy‑id`, `ReferencePlane`**, with **units/scale/polarity** typed under **MM‑CHR / CG‑Spec**, and lawful references to `DescriptorMapRef`/`DistanceDefRef`. *(Row schema: F.17; shipping via G.10.)*  
2. **Parity & edition pins (Part G).** When QD/OEE is in scope, **pin** `DescriptorMapRef.edition` and `DistanceDefRef.edition` (and, where applicable, `CharacteristicSpaceRef.edition`, `TransferRulesRef.edition`) and record `policy‑id` + `PathSliceId`. Treat **illumination/coverage as report‑only telemetry**; publish an **Illumination Map** where G‑kit mandates parity artefacts. **Declare S** (Scale Variables) and run at least one **scale‑probe** (two points along S) when claiming **scale‑amenability**. **Dominance policy defaults to `ParetoOnly`;** including illumination in dominance **MUST** cite a CAL policy‑id.
3. **Tell‑Show‑Show (E.7/E.8).** Any arhitectural pattern that claims generative behaviour **MUST** embed **both** a **U.System** and a **U.Episteme** illustration using this glossary (manager‑first didactics). 

#### 4.3 Minimal recipe (run this on day one)
1) Declare **CG‑Frame** (what “quality” means; lawful units/scales) and **ReferencePlane**.  
2) Pick 2–4 **Q components** + a simple **DescriptorMap** (≥2 dims) for N/D; publish **editions**.  
3) Choose an **E/E‑LOG policy** (explore↔exploit budget); record **policy‑id**.  
4) Call the selector under **G.5** with parity pins; **return a set** (Pareto/Archive), not a single score.  
5) **Publish to UTS** + **PathIds/PathSliceId**; **Illumination Map** is **report‑only telemetry** by default.

### 5) Archetypal Grounding
*Informative; manager‑first (E.7/E.8 Tell‑Show‑Show).*  <!-- exact heading per CC‑AG.1 -->

**Show‑A - SRE capacity plan (selector returns a set).**
*Frame.* We must raise service commitment headroom for Q4 without breaking latency SLOs.
*Portfolio.* `{cache‑expansion, read‑replicas, query‑shaping, circuit‑breaker tuning, schema‑denorm}`.
*Glossary in action.* `U = latency@p95 & error‑rate`, `C = budget ≤ $X, risk ≤ R`, `N = dissimilarity to current playbook`, `Diversity_P = adds a previously empty niche in our archive (e.g., “shifts load to edge”)`. E/E‑LOG starts **Explore‑heavy**, flips **Exploit‑heavy** once ≥ K distinct niches are lit. *(Publish UTS row + parity pins; illumination stays report‑only telemetry.)*  

**Show‑B - Policy search with QD archive (MAP‑Elites‑class).**
*Frame.* Robotics team explores gaits that trade stability vs energy use.
*Glossary in action.* `CharacteristicSpace = {step‑frequency, lateral‑stability}`, `ArchiveConfig = CVT grid`, `N` from descriptor distance, `U` = task reward, `Diversity_P` = coverage gain; **PortfolioMode=Archive**. Families include **MAP‑Elites (2015)**, **CMA‑ME/MAE (2020–)**, **Differentiable QD/MEGA (2022–)**, **QDax (2024)**; publish editions and policy‑ids; treat illumination as **report‑only telemetry**.  

*(Optional)* **Show‑C - OEE parity (POET/Enhanced‑POET).**
Co‑evolve `{environment, method}` portfolios; publish **coverage/regret** as telemetry metrics; pin `TransferRulesRef.edition`; return *sets*, not a single winner. 
  
**Show‑Epi - Evidence synthesis (U.Episteme).**
*Frame.* A living review compares rival **causal identification** methods (e.g., IV vs. DiD vs. RCT‑adjacent surrogates) across policy domains.
*Glossary in action.* `U = external‑validity gain @ F/G‑declared lanes`, `C = ethics & data‑licence constraints`, `N = dissimilarity in **ClaimGraph** transformations`, `D_P = coverage of identification niches in the archive`. `ReferencePlane = episteme`. Illumination/coverage stays **report‑only telemetry**; selection returns a **portfolio** of methods per niche. *(Publish UTS rows; cite Bridges + CL for cross‑domain reuse; edition‑pin Descriptor/Distance defs where QD applies.)*

### 6) Bias‑Annotation

**Scope.** Trans‑disciplinary; glossary applies to both **System** and **Episteme** work.
**Known risks & mitigations.**
*Over‑aggregation:* forbid mixed‑scale sums; use **CG‑frame** and **MM‑CHR**.
*Terminology drift:* enforce **LEX‑BUNDLE** registers; ban tool jargon in Core.
*Optimization monoculture:* require **portfolio** publication where G‑kit mandates parity; illumination stays **report‑only telemetry** unless a CAL policy promotes it (policy‑id cited).   

### 7) Conformance Checklist (SCR/RSCR stubs)

| ID          | Requirement                                                                                                                                                                               | Purpose                                                                         |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CC‑A0‑1** | If a pattern/UTS row **describes a generator, selector, or portfolio**, it **MUST** surface **N, U, C, Diversity_P, `ReferencePlane`, and E/E‑LOG `policy‑id`**; **units/scale/polarity** **MUST** be declared. | Makes generative claims comparable and auditable (UTS as publication surface).  |
| **CC‑A0‑2** | When QD/OEE is in scope, **pin** editions: `DescriptorMapRef.edition`, `DistanceDefRef.edition` (and, where applicable, `CharacteristicSpaceRef.edition`, `TransferRulesRef.edition`); log `PathSliceId` and policy‑ids. | Enables lawful *parity/refresh*; edition‑aware telemetry.                       |
| **CC‑A0‑3** | **No mixed‑scale roll‑ups**; ordinal data **SHALL NOT** be averaged; any roll‑up **MUST** live under a declared **CG‑frame**.                                                             | Prevents illegal scoring; keeps comparisons lawful.                             |
| **CC‑A0‑4** | Where the G‑kit requires parity, **publish an Illumination Map** (coverage per niche); **single‑number leaderboards are non‑conformant** on the Core surface when a ParityReport is required. | Portfolio‑first publication; avoids single‑winner bias.                         |
| **CC‑A0‑5** | Keep **illumination/coverage** as **report‑only telemetry**; **dominance policy defaults to `ParetoOnly`**; any change is CAL‑authorised and cited by policy‑id.                                          | Separates fit from exploration; preserves auditability.                         |
| **CC‑A0‑6** | Apply **E.7/E.8**: include a **U.System** and a **U.Episteme** illustration when claiming generative behaviour; obey **E.10** register hygiene; use the exact subsection title **“Archetypal Grounding.”** | Locks didactic primacy; prevents jargon drift.                                  |
| **CC-A0-7** | **ReferencePlane declared** for every N/U/C/Diversity_P head and **CL^plane** penalties **route to R only**; **Φ_plane** policy-id published when planes differ.                            | Prevents plane/stance category errors; aligns with Bridge/**GateCrossing visibility** guards (Bridge+UTS+CL/Φ_plane). |
| **CC‑A0‑8** | **Diversity_P ≠ Illumination.** Diversity_P may enter dominance; **Illumination** remains **report‑only telemetry** unless explicitly promoted by CAL policy‑id.                                         | Matches QD triad semantics and parity defaults.                                 |
| **CC‑A0‑9** | If a generator/selector is claimed **scale‑amenable**, **declare S (Scale Variables)** and an **E/E‑LOG scale policy‑id**; otherwise mark **S = N/A**.                                      | Makes scale assumptions explicit and comparable across contexts.                 |
| **CC‑A0‑10** | For scale‑amenable claims, execute a **scale‑probe** (≥ 2 points along S) and report a **Scale Elasticity class** (*rising/knee/flat*) in the UTS row.                                      | Forces early strategy‑relevant evidence without over‑specifying numerics.        |
| **CC‑A0‑11** | Apply **Iso‑Scale Parity** in parity runs when S is declared; where infeasible, state the **loss notes** and treat results as **non‑parity** with an explicit penalty in **R**.             | Keeps comparisons fair and auditable under scale constraints.                    |
| **CC‑A0‑12** | **BLP default.** If a domain‑specific heuristic is selected over a general, scale‑amenable method, record a **BLP‑waiver** reason: *deontic*, *scale‑probe overturn*, or *context‑specific*. | Prevents silent violations of the Bitter Lesson; improves selector transparency. |

### 8) Consequences

**Benefits.**
• **Immediate usability** for engineer‑managers (plain one‑liners) with **formal anchors** for auditors.
• **Portfolio‑first** culture (sets & illumination) instead of brittle leaderboards.
• **Edition‑aware comparability**; parity/refresh is routine, not ad‑hoc.

**Trade‑offs & mitigations.**
• Slightly longer UTS rows → mitigated by consistent schema and copy‑paste snippets.
• Requires discipline on units/scales → mitigated by CG‑frame templates.

### 9) Rationale

This pattern **instantiates P‑10 Open‑Ended Evolution** by making *generation‑selection‑publication* **operational** at the on‑ramp: readers get just enough shared vocabulary to run *search as standard practice*. It aligns with **Didactic Primacy (P‑2)** and **LEX‑BUNDLE (E.10)** by keeping definitions *plain‑first* and scale‑lawful, and with **Patterns Layering (P‑5)** by pointing to C.17–C.19 for formal anchors without tool lock‑in. The post‑2015 line (MAP‑Elites → CMA‑ME/MAE → Differentiable QD/MEGA → QDax; POET/Enhanced‑POET/Darwinian Goedel Machine) normalised **quality‑diversity** and **open‑endedness** as first‑class search objectives; this glossary surfaces those ideas as **publication standards**, not tool recipes.  

### 10) Relations

**Builds on.** **E.2 Pillars** (P-10, P-2, P-6), **A.5** (Open-Ended Kernel), **B.5/B.5.2.1** (Abductive loops + NQD integration), **C.17–C.19** (Creativity-CHR, NQD-CAL, E/E-LOG).    

**Coordinates with.** **E.7/E.8** (Archetypal Grounding; Authoring template), **E.10** (LEX‑BUNDLE), **F.17** (UTS), **G.5/G.9–G.12** (set‑returning selectors, **iso‑scale** parity, shipping & refresh).
**Constrains.** Any generator/selector/portfolio publication on the Core surface: **N‑U‑C‑Diversity_P + policy‑ids; S/Scale‑probe where applicable; parity pins; lawful scales; portfolio‑first where mandated**. (Ties into UTS rows and parity artefacts.)
**Editor’s cross‑reference.** For agentic orchestration of scalable tool‑calls under **BLP**/**SLL**, see **C.24 (Agent‑Tools‑CAL)**.

### Editor’s note (implementation hint)

This pattern is an **on‑ramp**: it **does not replace** C.17–C.19. It binds Plain definitions to **publication/telemetry** expectations so newcomers can *use* NQD/E/E‑LOG immediately while experts follow the formal trails.
