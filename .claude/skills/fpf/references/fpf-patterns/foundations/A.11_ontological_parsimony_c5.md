## A.11 - Ontological Parsimony (C‑5)

*“Add only what you cannot subtract.”*

### A.11:1 - Context

The FPF kernel aspires to remain **small enough to learn in a week** yet **broad enough** to model engines, proofs and budgets alike. Unchecked growth of primitives—well‑known from earlier “enterprise ontologies”—bloats diagrams, stalls tooling and intimidates new adopters. C‑5 therefore demands *minimal‑sufficiency*: a new core concept enters the kernel **only** when all routes of composition, refinement or role‑projection fail to express it without semantic loss.


### A.11:2 - Problem

| Pathology         | Real‑world symptom                                                                 |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Concept creep** | Near‑synonyms proliferate (`U.Worker`, `U.Employee`, `U.Staff`), breaking queries. |
| **Zombie types**  | Legacy primitives linger unused yet block name space.                              |
| **Tool churn**    | Every fresh primitive forces IDE, validator and dashboard updates.                 |

Result: steep learning curves, fragile integrations, eroded trust in “first‑principles” promises.


### A.11:3 - Forces

| Force                            | Tension                                                            |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Expressiveness vs Simplicity** | Fine granularity helps static checks ↔ fewer nouns aid cognition.  |
| **Inclusivity vs Purity**        | New domains want vocabulary ↔ kernel must not be a dumping ground. |
| **Evolution vs Stability**       | Framework grows ↔ users depend on a stable core.                   |
| **Prestige vs Utility**          | Authors enjoy naming things ↔ every name tcharacteristics everyone else.      |


### A.11:4 - Solution — Four‑Gate **Minimal‑Sufficiency Protocol**

A proposal to add a `U.Type` or core relation **MUST** clear **all four gates** before admission and survives under a **Sunset Timer** thereafter.

| Gate                      | Test question                                                                                         | Rationale                                             |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **G‑1 Composition**       | *Can existing primitives + roles/attributes express the concept without material loss?*               | Follows “composition over creation.”                  |
| **G‑2 Non‑Redundancy**    | *Does the proposal overlap ≥ 80 % with anything already live?*                                        | Blocks synonyms.                                      |
| **G‑3 Functional Naming** | *Does the chosen name state **what the thing does**, not what it *is made of*?*                       | Prevents vague catch‑alls; supports didactic clarity. |
| **G‑4 Sharp Boundary**    | *Is there a one‑sentence litmus test that unambiguously includes or excludes any candidate instance?* | Ensures crisp taxonomy edges.                         |

**Lifecycle — Sunset Timer**
A cleared type enters the kernel **provisionally** with a timer (default = 4 quarters). If usage count remains zero at expiry, the type faces *Sunset Review*: delete, demote to Extention Pattern, or renew with fresh evidence.

> *Manager’s mnemonic:* **“Compose, Unique, Functional, Crisp — or sunset.”**


### A.11:5 - Archetypal Grounding

| Gate    | **Rejected candidate** (why)                                                                                                                                                                               | **Accepted approach**           |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **G‑1** | `U.CoolantPump` – expressible as `U.System:Pump` + `CoolingCirculatorRole`.                                                                                                                                | Composition via Role.           |
| **G‑2** | `U.Actuator` vs existing `U.Transformer` (90 % overlap).                                                                                                                                                   | Retain broader `U.Transformer`. |
| **G‑3** | `U.MiscellaneousObject` – name signals no function.                                                                                                                                                        | Reject; unclear purpose.        |
| **G‑4** | `U.SmallPart` – boundary depends on subjective size.                                                                                                                                                       | Reject; fails crisp test.       |
| —       | **`U.ProvenanceChain`** – required to record immutable evidence lineage; cannot be composed; functionally named; crisp membership rule (*“ordered list of Evidence Graph Ref with forward integrity hash”*). | Accepted, timer started.        |

### A.11:6 - Conformance Checklist

| ID          | Requirement                                                                                                                                               | Didactic aim                                                 |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **CC‑OP 1** | A *Minimal‑Sufficiency Form* (≤ 1 page) **MUST** accompany every new kernel‑type proposal, documenting answers to Gates G‑1…G‑4 and a draft Sunset‑Timer. | Forces authors to think compositionally before adding nouns. |
| **CC‑OP 2** | Kernel inventory tooling **SHALL** stamp each admitted type with `sunset_due: <date>` (default = +4 quarters).                                            | Schedules later pruning; no forgotten zombies.               |
| **CC‑OP 3** | A quarterly *Usage Scan* **MUST** flag any core type with reference‑count = 0; flagged items enter Sunset Review automatically.                           | Turns parsimony into a living maintenance loop.              |
| **CC‑OP 4** | Renaming, aliasing, or splitting an existing type **REQUIRES** re‑passing all four gates and documenting a migration note.                                | Prevents redundancy re‑entering via back door.               |
| **CC‑OP 5** | Patterns **SHOULD** favour `Role` + attributes over proposing new domain types; proposals rejected when Gate G‑1 answer is “yes.”          | Extends parsimony culture beyond the kernel.                 |


### A.11:7 - Consequences

| Benefit                            | Impact for engineer‑managers                                                   | Trade‑off / Mitigation                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Lean kernel**                    | Fewer primitives → faster onboarding & clearer mental map.                     | Initial author effort to fill Minimal‑Sufficiency Form; template wizard auto‑fills 70 %. |
| **Reduced tool churn**             | Stable set of nouns keeps dashboards, linters, reasoners in sync for years.    | Occasionally slows acceptance of niche concepts; Extention Patterns layer absorbs urgency.          |
| **Automatic house‑cleaning**       | Sunset cycle prevents accrual of deadwood.                                     | Rare risk of deleting a sleeper hit; renewal path allows appeal.                         |
| **Encultured composition mindset** | Teams default to roles & attributes, boosting reuse and cross‑domain dialogue. | Requires role libraries and attribute taxonomies; provided in Part C.                    |


### A.11:8 - Rationale

**Cognitive science** shows working memory tops out around 4 ± 1 unfamiliar chunks (Cowan 2021). Combining that with Gate discipline keeps kernel size tractable (≈ 40 primitives). **Software metrics** from lean DSLs (Rust traits, Kubernetes CRDs) reveal that compositional modelling reduces change propagation cost by \~30 %. The Sunset Timer borrows from Kubernetes feature gate “alpha/beta/GA” progression model — proved effective at pruning half‑baked APIs.

### A.11:9 - Relations

| Relation          | Pattern                 | Interaction                                               |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Builds on**     | A 8 Universal Core      | A candidate must already pass the Three‑Domain Test.      |
| **Supports**      | A 7 Strict Distinction  | Prevents near‑duplicate roles that blur layer boundaries. |
| **Feeds**         | B 5 Kernel Change‑Log   | Records admissions, renames, sunsets.                     |
| **Complementary** | A 10 Evidence Graph Referring | Proposals cite evidence of irreducibility.                |


### A.11:10 - Illustrative Uses (2022 – 2025)

* **Robotics CAL 2023** – `U.LiDARSensor` rejected (Gate G‑1 passed via role composition), saving three schema migrations.
* **Green‑Finance CAL 2024** – `U.CarbonCredit` admitted provisionally, but Sunset Review (usage = 0) demoted it to sector pattern, avoiding kernel noise.
* **Neuro‑informatics 2025** – `U.ProvenanceChain` accepted; by Q3 its heavy reuse in three patterns lifted timer and marked it *established*.


### A.11:11 - Open Questions

1. **Hard size cap** — should the kernel enforce an absolute limit (e.g., 64 live types) beyond which any new entry forces retirement of an old one?
2. **Semantic similarity tooling** — can embedding models automate Gate G‑2 overlap detection reliably across domains?
3. **Gate calibration** — is default Sunset Timer (4 quarters) optimal for research‑oriented patterns with slower uptake?
