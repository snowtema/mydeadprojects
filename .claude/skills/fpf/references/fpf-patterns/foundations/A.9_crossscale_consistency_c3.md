## A.9 - Cross‑Scale Consistency (C‑3)

> *“The logic of a bolt must still be the logic of the bridge.”*

### A.9:1 - Context

FPF models reality as a **nested holarchy**: parts → assemblies → systems → supra‑systems; axioms → lemmas → theorems → paradigms. Designers and analysts must zoom freely without logical whiplash. Classical mereology and modern renormalisation theory both warn: if rules mutate across scales, predictions and audits collapse. FPF therefore mandates a single, scale‑invariant Standard.


### A.9:2 - Problem

| Failure Mode              | Real‑World Symptom                                         |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Invalid extrapolation** | Unit‑tested module fails once integrated.                  |
| **Brittle dashboards**    | Portfolio KPI “green” hides a red supplier averaged away.  |
| **Compositional chaos**   | Different teams’ roll‑ups yield non‑deterministic results. |

These pathologies derail safety cases and budget decisions across disciplines.


### A.9:3 - Forces

| Force                                  | Tension                                                      |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Local autonomy vs Global coherence** | Free optimisation of parts ↔ predictable behaviour of whole. |
| **Simplicity vs Fidelity**             | Single rule‑set ↔ non‑linear, emergent effects.              |
| **Determinism vs Emergence**           | Stable roll‑ups ↔ need to legitimise genuine synergy jumps.  |
| **Didactic clarity vs Formal rigour**  | Managers grasp intent quickly ↔ analysts can prove it.       |


### A.9:4 - Solution — Invariant Quintet + Meta‑Holon Transition

#### A.9:4.1 - Invariant Quintet

Any aggregation operator `Γ` that claims FPF conformance **MUST** preserve these five invariants :

| Code     | Invariant             | One‑line Intuition                               |
| -------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **IDEM** | *Idempotence*         | Folding a singleton changes nothing.             |
| **COMM** | *Local Commutativity* | Order of independent folds is irrelevant.        |
| **LOC**  | *Locality*            | Worker or partition choice cannot affect result. |
| **WLNK** | *Weakest‑Link Bound*  | Whole never outperforms its frailest part.       |
| **MONO** | *Monotonicity*        | Improving a part cannot worsen the whole.        |

*Mnemonic:* **S‑O‑L‑I‑D** (Same - Order‑free - Location‑free - Inferior cap - Don’t‑regress).

**Inter‑Layer Standard note**
When holons are composed as a Layered‑Control stack, each Planner ↔ Regulator pair MUST publish an inter‑layer Standard: {referenceSignal, guaranteedTrackingError, cycleTime}.  Matni 2024 (https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15185) prove such Standards satisfy COMM + LOC invariants, giving a constructive instance of the Quintet.

#### A.9:4.2 - Meta‑Holon Transition (MHT)

If empirical data show a true violation (e.g., redundancy raises WLNK limit), the modeller **declares an MHT**: the collection becomes a new holon tier, and the quintet applies anew at that scale .


### A.9:5 - Archetypal Grounding

| Invariant  | **`U.System` — Pump Skid**                    | **`U.Episteme` — Meta‑Analysis**                |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| IDEM       | One‑pump skid ≅ that pump.                    | Single‑study review ≅ that study.               |
| COMM / LOC | Pumps welded in any order / yard → same spec. | Labs contribute in any order → same statistics. |
| WLNK       | Pressure rating ≤ weakest pump.               | Reliability ≤ least‑replicated study.           |
| MONO       | Stronger motor never lowers flow.             | Larger sample size never lowers confidence.     |


### A.9:6 - Conformance Checklist

| ID          | Requirement                                                                                                                                                                                      | Purpose (manager‑friendly)                                |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CC‑A9‑1** | Every calculus that defines an aggregation operator `Γ` **SHALL** provide a plain‑language note and a formal argument for how `Γ` upholds **all five invariants** (IDEM, COMM, LOC, WLNK, MONO). | Makes the Standard both human‑readable and checkable.     |
| **CC‑A9‑2** | A *singleton fold* (` card (parts) = 1 `) **MUST** return the part unaltered (IDEM). | Locks the recursion base case. |
| **CC‑A9‑3** | Folding two independent sub‑graphs in any order or on any compute site **MUST** yield equal results (COMM + LOC).                                                                                | Enables safe parallel work and reproducible analytics.    |
| **CC‑A9‑4** | No aggregate metric **MAY** exceed the minimum of that metric across parts unless an **MHT** is declared (WLNK).                                                                                 | Prevents stealth inflation of reliability or truth.       | 
| **CC‑A9‑6** | A declared **Meta‑Holon Transition** **SHALL**: (a) name the new supervisory holon; (b) cite the data triggering the transition; (c) restate how the quintet holds at the new scale.             | Ensures emergence is captured explicitly, not hand‑waved. |


### A.9:7 - Consequences

| Benefit                      | Why it matters                                                   | Trade‑off / Mitigation                                                           |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Stable roll‑ups**          | Summaries and reports remain faithful as parts evolve.          | Requires early agreement on `Γ`; offer reference libraries.                      |
| **Visible risk floor**       | WLNK blocks “averaging away” critical weaknesses.                | Can look overly conservative; redundancy, when real, lifts the minimum honestly. |
| **Parallel progress**        | COMM + LOC allow distributed teams to integrate without re‑work. | Needs explicit independence assumptions; templates guide authors.                |
| **Objective emergence flag** | Quintet failure becomes a measurable R\&D signal.                | Teams must learn to document MHTs instead of ignoring anomalies.                 |


### A.9:8 - Rationale

*Post‑2015 evidence across domains*

* **Physics** ‑ Renormalisation coherence echoes IDEM, COMM, LOC.
* **Distributed data platforms** rely on COMM + LOC for deterministic aggregations.
* **Safety engineering** ‑ Fault‑tree analyses hinge on WLNK; aviation failures (2018‑24) confirm its necessity.
* **Lean improvement** ‑ MONO underpins Kaizen: fix a bottleneck, never worsen the plant.

Packaging these insights as one memorisable quintet → **Cognitive Elegance** with formal bite.

### A.9:10 - Known Uses (2018‑2025)

* **Spacecraft avionics** ‑ Applying WLNK exposed a sub‑grade connector, saving a \$40 M launch window.
* **Global vaccine meta‑reviews** ‑ COMM + LOC let five epidemiology teams merge data independently; results converged within 0.1 % effect size.
* **Distributed ML training** ‑ MONO guaranteed optimiser swaps never reduced accuracy, cutting iteration time by 20 %.


### A.9:11 - Open Questions for expert panel

1. **Order‑sensitive physics** – Should quantum‑circuit folds live in a Extention Patterns with a relaxed invariant set?
2. **Synergistic redundancy** – Can WLNK be reframed using an “effective minimum” when true redundancy lifts the floor?
3. **Didactic tooling** – Which visual cues best alert non‑formal audiences to an approaching Meta‑Holon Transition?
4. **Layer depth** — In an LCA (layered control architectures, https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15185) stack every Planner is external to its Regulator; should FPF limit the number of nested layers, or is indefinite chaining acceptable?
