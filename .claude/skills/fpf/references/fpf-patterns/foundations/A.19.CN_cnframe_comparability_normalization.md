## A.19.CN - CN‑frame (comparability & normalization)

> **Scope.** This CN‑frame Algebra & Normalization Discipline **extends A.19** by fixing the **governance Standard** for CN‑frames, defining a **conformance checklist** and **regression harness**, and providing **didactic one‑pagers** and **anti‑patterns** so teams can introduce CN‑frames without tool lock‑in. The mandatory pattern structure and authoring discipline from **Part E** (Style Guide, Tell‑Show‑Show, checklists, DRR, guard‑rails) are applied throughout.
>
> **Single‑owner boundary (cite, don’t duplicate).** A.19.CN owns the **CN‑frame governance surface** (`CN‑Spec`, registry, bridges, checklist/harness). It does **not** own any CHR‑mechanism **intensions**, term cards, or method taxonomies. Those are owned by the corresponding mechanism patterns (**A.19.UNM / A.19.UINDM / A.19.USCM / A.19.ULSAM / A.19.CPM / A.19.SelectorMechanism**)**. Evidence/backing is owned by **C.16**; legality gates are owned by **G.0**. Therefore A.19.CN specifies *where the references live*, *what must be cite‑able for audit*, and *how governance changes trigger regression* — not mechanism semantics.

### A.19.CN:1 - Context

A.19 established a substrate‑neutral picture:

* a **CN‑frame** = *(Context‑local)* **CharacteristicSpace (CS)** + **chart** (coordinate patch + units) + a referenced **Normalization mechanism (UNM)** pinned from `CN‑Spec.normalization`. Any semantics of admissibility, invariants, and `≡_UNM` is owned by the UNM owner (see **A.19.UNM**);
* **operators** (subspace, product, pullback/pushforward) and **comparability** (coordinatewise vs **normalization‑based (normalize‑then‑compare)**);
* **RSG touch‑points**: role readiness (**RSG** states) are **certified** against CS via **checklists** over observable characteristics;
* **entity/relational mixtures** across CN‑frames via minimal schemas and bridges.

**Terminology guard.** *CN‑frame* is the **lens** (I); *CN‑Spec* is the **governance card** (S) that fixes admissible charts/normalization *references*/comparability/Γ‑fold for that lens **in one `U.BoundedContext`**; *CN‑Description* is the didactic surface (D) with worked examples and anti‑patterns. Mechanism‑level term cards (e.g., `NormalizationMethod`, `NormalizationMethodInstance`, `NCV`, `≡_UNM`, `IndicatorChoicePolicy`) are owned by the corresponding **A.19.<MechId>** patterns and are only **cited** here.

**Lexical guard (map/Map, by reference).** Follow the lexical discipline owned by **A.19.UNM**: avoid introducing new normalization tokens that use “map/Map/mapping” (because `…Map` is a Part‑G method‑type kind). In normalization contexts prefer **normalize / transform / re‑parameterize**. Legacy tokens (including retired κ‑notation) are handled via **alias docking** (F.18); A.19.CN applies this rule and does not redefine it.

A.19.CN makes this *operational and auditable*.

### A.19.CN:2 - Problem

Absent a governance layer, four failure modes recur:

1. **Chartless numbers.** Measures move between teams without units, reference states, or declared normalization → **illusory comparability**.
2. **Hidden normalization flips.** Re‑parameterisations (e.g., normalising by batch size) silently alter meaning; trend lines lie.
3. **CN‑frame sprawl.** Every initiative mints a new “dashboard dimension”; semantics diverge; assurance collapses.
4. **Un‑bridgeable reports.** Cross‑team roll‑ups average **incongruent** CN‑frames, violating the **weakest‑link (WLNK)** discipline from Γ and B.3.

### A.19.CN:3 - Forces

| Force                         | Tension we must balance                                                              |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Universality vs nuance**    | One Standard for robotics, safety, finance — yet leave each context’s idioms intact. |
| **Speed vs audit**            | Light ceremony for on‑ramp; hard guarantees for assurance and SoD.                   |
| **Local truth vs federation** | Keep CN‑frames meaning‑local; still enable **explicit** bridging across Contexts.          |
| **Minimalism vs safety**      | Few mandatory slots; enough structure to forbid silent normalization drift.                  |  


### A.19.CN:4 - Solution — **The CN‑Spec** (CN‑Spec) + **Registry** + **Bridges**

#### A.19.CN:4.1 - The **CN‑Spec** (comparability & normalization specification per CN‑frame, in one `U.BoundedContext`)

A **CN‑frame** is governed by a compact, notation‑free card:

```
CN‑Spec {
  name              : CN‑frameName                  // local to Context
  context           : U.BoundedContext              // edition/version included
  cs_basis          : [{
    slot_id         : <tech-token>,                 // stable slot id (basis name)
    characteristic  : <U.Characteristic>,          // per A.17 / A.18
    scale           : { type: nominal|ordinal|interval|ratio, unit?: <U.Unit>, bounds?: <… > },
    polarity        : up|down|target-range,        // comparison orientation
    // if needed: missingness?, admissible_domain? (MM‑CHR‑consistent metadata)
  }]
  chart             : { reference_state, coordinate_patch, measurement_protocol_ref }
  normalization     : {
   UNM_id?,                                      // reference to the UNM mechanism; canonical Intension: A.19.UNM
   methods: [NormalizationMethodId],              // UNM-owned tokens; semantics live in A.19.UNM
   instances?: [NormalizationMethodInstanceId],   // UNM-owned tokens; evidence/backing lives in C.16
   method_descriptions: [NormalizationMethodDescriptionRef], // refs only; semantics/corpus live with the semantic owner
   admissible_reparameterizations,                // UNM-owned declarations (opaque here; see A.19.UNM)
   invariants,                                    // UNM-owned invariant tokens (opaque here; see A.19.UNM)
   fix?: <NormalizationFixSpec>                   // UNM-owned fix spec (opaque here; see A.19.UNM)
   }
  comparability     : { mode ∈ {coordinatewise, normalization-based}, minimal_evidence }  // `minimal_evidence` is a gate reference (default: CG‑Spec.MinimalEvidence; see G.0/C.16)
  indicator_policy? : { IndicatorChoicePolicyRef, scope, edition }  // policy ref only; semantics owned by A.19.UINDM
  acceptance        : { checklist_for_admission, window, evidence_anchors } // gates RSG state checks
  aggregation       : { Γ_fold, WLNK/COMM/LOC/MONO choices, time_policy }   // fold tokens only; semantics owned by B.3/G.0 (and the folding mechanism card, if cited)
  alignment?        : { bridges_to_other_contexts, CL_levels, loss_notes }  // optional
  lifecycle         : { owner_role, DRR_links, deprecation_plan }
}
```

**Reading:** *A CN‑frame is a context‑local lens with declared characteristics and a chart to read them. `CN‑Spec` pins the **references and governance choices** needed to make admission, comparability, and safe roll‑ups auditable: the UNM reference for normalization‑based comparability, an optional `IndicatorChoicePolicyRef`, an explicit `Γ_fold`, and the admission checklist. Any mechanism semantics (e.g., what `≡_UNM` means, or what counts as an Indicator) is owned by the corresponding mechanism pattern and is only cited from here.*

**Ownership note.** CN‑Spec stores only the **governance surface** (references and declarations). The semantics and term cards for `NormalizationMethod*`, `≡_UNM`, `NCV`, `IndicatorChoicePolicy`, and any other CHR‑mechanism vocabulary are owned by the corresponding mechanism patterns (e.g., **A.19.UNM**, **A.19.UINDM**) and evidence backing lives in **C.16**. (Kernel reminder: per **A19‑CS‑5**, `U.CharacteristicSpace` carries no hidden normalizations or aggregations.) In A.6.1 terms, `UNM_id` points to a canonical **`U.Mechanism.Intension`** card; the CN‑Spec **references** that mechanism and does **not** introduce implicit **Transport**.

**L‑CN‑Spec‑NORM‑IDs (by reference).** When CN‑Spec (or its audit trail) needs stable normalization tokens, use **NormalizationMethodId**/**NormalizationMethodInstanceId** as specified by the UNM owner (A.19.UNM). Avoid generic “map” nouns and retired κ‑notation (see the **A.19.UNM** lexical guard); preserve legacy tokens only via **F.18 alias docking**. If you introduce reference‑typed fields, obey **A.6.5** (`*Ref` reserved for reference fields; `*Slot` reserved for SlotKinds).

#### A.19.CN:4.2 - **CN‑frame Registry** (per Context)

Each `U.BoundedContext` keeps a **CN‑frame Registry** (VR):

* **canonical names** and **editions**;
* **SoD hooks** (who can edit CN‑Spec, who can certify admission);
* **deprecation map** (what replaces what, when).

#### A.19.CN:4.3 - **Bridges** (across contexts)

Cross‑context reuse occurs **only** via explicit **Alignment Bridges** (F.9) between CN‑Specs:

```
Bridge CN‑frameA@Context1  →  CN‑frameB@Context2
  channel: {Scope|Kind}                 // F.9 (and A.6.1 Transport)
  planes: ReferencePlane(src,tgt)       // C.2.1 (must be recorded)
  CL: {3|2|1|0}
  CL_plane?: {3|2|1|0}                  // only when planes differ
  kept_characteristics: [… ]
  lost_characteristics: [… ]
  transform: {pullback | pushforward | re-scaling | re-binning | … }  // illustrative; use the operator vocabulary owned by A.19/F.9
  extra_guards: {additional evidence / reviewer role / waiver speech-act}
```

**CL policy (reference).** **CL levels and the penalty Φ(CL) are defined in B.3** (CL is **ordinal**; do not average). In A.6.1 terms, any cross‑context (or cross‑plane) reuse is declared **only** via a mechanism’s **Transport** clause: **name the BridgeId and channel** (`Scope|Kind`) and **record** `ReferencePlane(src,tgt)`; if planes differ, declare the `CL^plane` regime. **Transport is declarative** (it does not introduce a `U.Transfer` edge and does not restate CL ladders or Φ tables). When both scope and *describedEntity* change, apply the **two‑bridge rule** (Scope bridge + **KindBridge (CL^k)**). Penalties from scope/kind/plane **route to `R/R_eff` only** (never to **F/G**). This CN‑Spec may **add operational guards** per level (e.g., “extra reviewer at CL=1”, “waiver at CL=2”), but it **does not redefine** the scale or Φ. For episteme‑specific frames, see also **B.1.3**.

### A.19.CN:5 - Conformance Checklist (normative)

> **Pass these and your CN‑frames are fit for assurance and cross‑team composition.**

**CC‑A19.D1‑1 (Local scope).** Every CN‑frame **MUST** live inside a declared `U.BoundedContext` (with edition). Names are **local**; same label in another Context ≠ same CN‑frame.

**CC‑A19.D1‑2 (Units & polarity).** Each characteristic in `cs_basis` **MUST** declare **unit/scale** and **polarity** (↑ better / ↓ better / target range). No unlabeled magnitudes.

**CC‑A19.D1‑3 (Chart).** `chart` **MUST** name the **reference state**, **coordinate patch** and **measurement protocol** (`U.MethodDescription`) to make numbers reproducible.

**CC‑A19.D1‑4 (Normalization references, not redefinition).** `normalization` **MUST** (i) cite the UNM mechanism (`UNM_id?`) and (ii) provide the normalization references required by the UNM owner (methods / invariants / fix, and instances when used) so that any normalization‑based comparison is auditable. This pattern does not define what a “NormalizationMethod” is — it requires that CN‑Spec can point to the owner that does.

**CC‑A19.D1‑5 (Comparability mode).** `comparability.mode` **MUST** be either **coordinatewise** (same chart & units) or **normalization‑based** (“normalize‑then‑compare” via the declared **UNM**). Mixed/implicit modes are prohibited. The semantics of `≡_UNM` (and what counts as “same class”) is owned by the UNM mechanism card (A.19.UNM); CN‑Spec only pins the references needed to audit the choice.

**CC‑A19.D1‑6 (Admission checklist).** `acceptance.checklist_for_admission` **MUST** be observable and time‑bounded; each datum admitted to the CN‑frame **SHALL** cite a **StateAssertion** or equivalent `U.Evaluation`.

**CC‑A19.D1‑7 (Aggregation discipline).** `aggregation.Γ_fold` **MUST** specify WLNK/COMM/LOC/MONO choices and the **time policy** (e.g., average of rates vs integral of counts). **No free‑hand averages.** The legality/semantics of folding is owned by **B.3/G.0** (and, when a folding mechanism is cited, by its mechanism owner); CN‑Spec only stores the governance pins.

**CC‑A19.D1‑8 (Bridge‑only reuse).** Cross‑context consumption **MUST** cite a **Bridge** with: (i) `channel ∈ {Scope|Kind}`, (ii) recorded `ReferencePlane(src,tgt)`, (iii) CL (and `CL^plane` when planes differ), and (iv) **loss notes**; coordinate‑by‑name without a Bridge **fails**. If the data participate in **gating/assurance**, apply **Φ(CL) per B.3**; this CN‑Spec does not restate Φ.

**CC‑A19.D1‑9 (SoD & roles).** Editing CN‑Spec and admitting data **MUST** be performed by **different** roles (⊥ enforced): `CN‑frameStewardRole ⊥ CN‑frameCertifierRole` inside the same context.

**CC‑A19.D1‑10 (Lifecycle & DRR).** Every CN‑Spec **MUST** carry an **owner role**, a **deprecation plan**, and links to **DRR** entries for rationale and changes (Part E.9).

**CC‑A19.D1‑11 (Anchors & lanes for comparability).** Any **admission** into a CN‑frame that is later **used for comparison/aggregation** **SHALL** cite the corresponding **A.10 EvidenceRole** anchors for each characteristic, with **assuranceUse lane** tags {TA, VA, LA} and **validity windows** (where applicable), so that the **SCR** can report lane‑separated contributions and freshness (B.3). Absence of anchors for a required characteristic renders items **incomparable**.

**CC‑A19.D1‑12 (Notation independence).** CN‑Spec content **MUST NOT** depend on a tool or file format; semantics precede notation (E.5.2 Notational Independence).

**CC‑A19.D1‑13 (Lexical guard‑rails).** characteristic names and role labels **MUST** follow the Part E lexical discipline (registers, twin labels; no overloaded “process/service/function”).

### A.19.CN:6 - Consequences (informative)

| Benefit                           | Why it matters                                                                                                        |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Auditable comparability**       | Chart + declared normalization (UNM + NormalizationMethods) make “same number” meaningful; silent re‑basings become explicit, reviewable choices.                   |
| **Safe roll‑ups**                 | Γ‑folds with WLNK/COMM/LOC/MONO stop optimistic averaging and preserve invariants.                                    |
| **Pluralism without incoherence** | Bridges with CL and loss notes allow federation without pretending to global sameness.                                |
| **RSG‑ready**                     | Admission checklists let **RSG** states reference **CN‑frame‑backed** facts (e.g., *Ready* requires characteristics within bounds). |

### A.19.CN:7 - Rationale (informative)

The CN‑Spec aligns A.19.CN with **Part E**: it packages Tell‑Show‑Show, Conformance Checklists, and DRR‑backed change, while honouring **DevOps Lexical Firewall**, **Unidirectional Dependency**, and **Notational Independence** so that semantics never depend on tooling.  It also operationalises B.3 **Trust & Assurance** by making CL penalties and WLNK folds first‑class.


### A.19.CN:8 - Archetypal Grounding *(Tell‑Show‑Show)*

> **Same slots, three arenas; no tooling implied.** The examples below use plain-language normalization descriptions as placeholders; any normative use must cite UNM-owned ids/refs (A.19.UNM) and evidence pins (C.16), not invent new terminology here.

#### A.19.CN:8.1 - **Industrial line** — *Weld‑quality CN‑frame* (`AssemblyLine_2026`)

* `cs_basis`: *BeadWidth\[mm] (target 6.0±0.2)*, *Porosity\[ppm] (↓)*, *SeamRate\[1/min] (↑ until limit)*
* `chart`: reference jig, fixture ID, torch type; `MethodDescription#Weld_MIG_v3`
* `normalization`: affine rescale on gray‑level calibration → invariant = physical porosity
* `comparability`: **normalization‑based (UNM)** (calibration tables applied)
* `aggregation`: WLNK on quality (min‑bound), COMM on counts, time = per‑shift histograms
* **RSG hook**: `WelderRole.Ready` requires *Porosity ≤ 500 ppm* & *BeadWidth within ±0.2 mm* admitted by this CN‑frame.

#### A.19.CN:8.2 - **Software/SRE line** — *Latency CN‑frame* (`SRE_Prod_Cluster_EU_2026`)

* `cs_basis`: *P50Latency\[ms] (↓)*, *P99Latency\[ms] (↓)*, *Load\[req/s]*
* `chart`: client vantage, trace sampler v4; `MethodDescription#HTTP_probe_v4`
* `normalization`: monotone time‑warp compensation for collector skew; invariant = percentile order
* `comparability`: **normalization‑based (UNM)** with declared normalization
* `aggregation`: MONO on latency (max of mins), WLNK across services
* **RSG hook**: `DeployerRole.Active` gated if **P99** < declared SLO over the admission window.

#### A.19.CN:8.3 - **Clinical/episteme line** — *Trial‑outcome CN‑frame* (`Cardio_2026`)

* cs_basis:
  - slot_id: ΔBP
    characteristic: BloodPressureChange
    scale: { type: ratio, unit: mmHg }
    polarity: down
  - slot_id: AdverseRate
    characteristic: AdverseEventRate
    scale: { type: ratio, unit: "%" }
    polarity: down
  - slot_id: Age
    characteristic: Age
    scale: { type: ratio, unit: years }
    polarity: neutral
* `chart`: cohort definition; `MethodDescription#TrialProtocol_v5`
* `normalization`: case‑mix adjustment (propensity score); invariant = adjusted ΔBP
* `comparability`: **normalization‑based (UNM)** (post‑adjustment)
* `aggregation`: LOC on subcohorts; WLNK on safety outcomes
* **RSG hook**: `EvidenceRole.Validated` admission requires CN‑frame acceptance; **Assurance** pulls CL from any Bridge used.

#### A.19.CN:8.4 - Worked mini-schemas (entity/relational mixtures across CN‑frames, informative)

To illustrate how CharacteristicSpace is used in practice, below are simplified schema snippets for three typical **CN‑frames**: an **Operations** view (run-time state and action gating), an **Assurance** view (evidence and cross-context comparison), and an **Alignment** view (design-time consistency across contexts). These examples mix entity-based and relational Characteristics and demonstrate how normalization and bridge *references* may appear in a model.

**Didactic-only note (no data governance).** The “schema/table” shapes below are purely explanatory: they show which **references must be cite-able** for audit and reproducibility. They are **not** storage requirements, do not prescribe file formats, and do not define the semantics of `NormalizationMethod*` tokens (see A.19.UNM / C.16).

##### A.19.CN:8.4.1 - Operations CN‑frame — Run-time gating & enactment

_Entity graph view:_

Holder (System) ── playsRoleOf ──> Role@Context ── has ──> RCS (slots…)
RSG (Role@Context) ── owns ──> State (◉ status)
Checklist (of State) ── testedBy ──> Evaluation ── yields ──> StateAssertion
Work ── performedBy ──> RoleAssignment
Work ── isExecutionOf ──> MethodDescription

In the above, a **Holder** (a system instance) plays a **Role** in some Context, which has an attached **RCS** (a set of slots defining its characteristic space). That Role’s **RSG** owns various possible **State** entries (each state could be, e.g., Ready, Waiting, Degraded, etc.). Each State has a **Checklist** which is **tested by** an Evaluation process, resulting in a **StateAssertion** (pass/fail) at runtime. Meanwhile, **Work** instances (concrete operations) are performed by the RoleAssignment and correspond to some MethodDescription (procedure). The “gate” for Work is that a StateAssertion for an enactable state must exist.

_Relational stub:_ (illustrating how information might be recorded)

| Table | Key Columns (essential) |
| --- | --- |
| **ROLE\_ASSIGNMENT** | `RA_ID` (PK); `HOLDER_ID`; `ROLE_ID`; `CONTEXT_ID`; `WINDOW_FROM`, `WINDOW_TO` |
| **RCS\_SNAPSHOT** | `SNAP_ID` (PK); `RA_ID` (FK to ROLE\_ASSIGNMENT); `WINDOW_FROM`, `WINDOW_TO`; `CHAR_ID`; `VALUE`; `UNIT`; `SCALE_TYPE` |
| **RSG\_STATE** | `STATE_ID` (PK); `ROLE_ID`; `CONTEXT_ID`; `NAME`; `ENACTABLE` (bool) |
| **CHECKLIST** | `CHK_ID` (PK); `STATE_ID` (FK to RSG\_STATE); `PREDICATE_TYPE`; `PREDICATE_SPEC` |
| **STATE\_ASSERTION** | `SA_ID` (PK); `RA_ID` (FK); `STATE_ID` (FK); `CHK_ID` (FK); `WINDOW_FROM`, `WINDOW_TO`; `VERDICT` (pass/fail); `NORMALIZATION_INSTANCE_ID`?; `BRIDGE_ID`? |  
| **WORK** | `WORK_ID` (PK); `RA_ID` (FK); `METHODDESC_ID` (FK to MethodDescription); `WINDOW_FROM`, `WINDOW_TO`; _(other fields like results or references)_ |

In this schema: an RCS snapshot table might log individual coordinate values (`VALUE`) for each Characteristic (`CHAR_ID`) in a given RoleAssignment, with their units and scale type noted (to ensure we know what the number means). The StateAssertion ties a RoleAssignment to a state checklist and says whether it passed, including references to any **NormalizationMethodInstance** or **Bridge** if cross-context or cross-scale comparisons were involved. The gate logic for enactment can then be a query like: “Is Work W admissible now?” – which joins through ROLE\_ASSIGNMENT to find the latest StateAssertion for that RA where `ENACTABLE=true` and `VERDICT=pass`.

##### A.19.CN:8.4.2 - Assurance CN‑frame — Evidence freshness & mapped comparisons

_Entity graph view:_

NormalizationMethodInstance ── appliesTo ──> Characteristic   (each instance is a scale‑appropriate, monotone transform within UNM)
Bridge (ContextB → ContextA)   (Alignment Bridge between contexts, with CL and loss notes)
StateAssertion ── uses ──> {NormalizationMethodInstance, Bridge}   (if a state comparison crossed contexts)

This view highlights that in the assurance context, we keep track of how we mapped or compared states:

* A **NormalizationMethodInstance** reference records that an admitted comparison/assertion relied on a declared normalization instance. The admissibility conditions, monotonicity constraints and evidence semantics are owned by **A.19.UNM** and **C.16**.
* A **Bridge** between Context B and Context A (for corresponding roles or states) carries a CL rating and possibly notes on what is “lost in translation.”
* A **StateAssertion** may **use** a NormalizationMethodInstance or a Bridge, meaning that assertion was reached by translating data via that instance or comparing across that bridge.

_Relational stub:_

| Table                | Key Columns (essential)                                                                                                               |

| **BRIDGE**           | `BRIDGE_ID` (PK); `FROM_ROLE@CTX`; `TO_ROLE@CTX`; `CL` (congruence-loss level, e.g. 0–3); `NOTES` (description of losses/adjustments) |
| **ASSURANCE\_EVENT** | `AE_ID` (PK); `SA_ID` (FK to StateAssertion); `EFFECT` (enum: penalty\_applied, evidence\_refreshed, etc.); `DETAILS`                 |

In this stub, **NORMALIZATION\_INSTANCE** records a mapping instance that has to be accounted for when reconstructing an assertion or comparison. The exact meaning of `FORMULA_SPEC`/`VALIDITY_WINDOW`/evidence pins is owned by the UNM and evidence patterns (A.19.UNM / C.16); the point here is that the instance is **referenceable** so audits can follow it. The Bridge table enumerates official Bridges between contexts (for example, bridging a “Ready” state in an engineering context to “Ready” in an operations context, with CL indicating how fully comparable they are). An ASSURANCE\_EVENT log could record when a penalty was applied due to a low-CL Bridge or when an assertion was refreshed or invalidated due to new evidence or time lapse.

##### A.19.CN:8.4.3 Alignment CN‑frame — Design-time reuse of states across Contexts

_Entity graph view:_

Checklist(ContextA.State)   ← pull(N) —   Checklist’(ContextB.State’)   (pull a checklist via **NormalizationMethodInstance** N)
Refinement π : RSG(Role' ≤ Role)   (RSG refinement mapping, e.g. Role' is a subtype of Role)

This view covers how _design-time_ alignment happens:

-   A **Checklist’** for a state in Context B can be **pulled** via a **NormalizationMethodInstance** into Context A to become a derived Checklist for a state in Context A. This is effectively what we described in the pull operation: using another context’s criteria in your own space.
    
-   A **Refinement π** is shown between RSGs indicating Role’ is a specialized role of Role (e.g. a sub-role or a scenario-specific role) and how their states relate (Role’ might have extra states or more granular distinctions). This refinement should maintain that for each state in Role’ that maps to a state in Role, the entails/implication relation holds for enactability.
    

_Relational stub:_ (illustrating how information might be recorded)

| Table               | Key Columns                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **RSG\_REFINEMENT** | `MAP_ID` (PK); `ROLEPRIME_ID` (FK to Role' in Context B); `ROLE_ID` (FK to Role in Context A); `STATEPRIME_ID` (FK to state in Role' RSG); `STATE_ID` (FK to state in Role RSG); `ENTAILS` (bool) |
| **CHECKLIST\_PULL** | `PULL_ID` (PK); `SRC_STATE_ID`; `TGT_STATE_ID`; `NORMALIZATION_INSTANCE_ID` (FK to NormalizationMethodInstance used); `VERSION`? /\* and perhaps timestamp \*/                                     |

In this stub, RSG\_REFINEMENT maps states of a sub-role to states of a super-role, with an `ENTAILS` flag indicating if being in the sub-state guarantees being in the super-state. **Every refinement mapping should ensure at least one enactable state in the sub-role corresponds to an enactable state in the super-role** (or else the sub-role would allow something the super-role doesn’t – that’s an alignment lint check). The CHECKLIST\_PULL table records that a state from one context has had its checklist pulled into another context via a **NormalizationMethodInstance** (identified by `NORMALIZATION_INSTANCE_ID`). This is a design artifact saying “State X in context A is defined by applying normalization instance N to State Y in context B’s criteria.” A version or validity field might ensure we know which edition of the checklist or normalization instance was used.


### A.19.CN:9 - Anti‑patterns (and the fix)

| Anti‑pattern            | Symptom                                   | Why it hurts                 | Fix (CN‑Spec slot)                           |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Chartless number**    | “Latency = 120”                           | No unit/vantage → untestable | Fill `cs_basis` + `chart`                          |
| **Normalization smuggling**     | Quiet “per‑unit” normalisation mid‑stream | Trend reversal               | Declare UNM normalization references (`NormalizationMethodId` / `NormalizationMethodInstanceId`) + named invariants (see A.19.UNM)        |
| **Bridge‑by‑name**      | Reusing labels across Contexts               | False comparability          | Author **Bridge** with CL + loss        |
| **Free‑hand averaging** | Arithmetic mean on bounded risks          | Violates WLNK                | Declare `Γ_fold` with WLNK              |
| **CN‑frame sprawl**        | Ten nearly‑identical CN‑frames               | Cognitive debt               | Use Registry + DRR; prefer reuse        |
| **Role conflation**     | Same person edits CN‑Spec & certifies data     | SoD breach                   | Enforce `CN‑frameSteward ⊥ CN‑frameCertifier` |

### A.19.CN:10 - Didactic quick cards (one‑liners teams reuse)

1. **Numbers travel with their Context.** Always cite `Context@Edition`.
2. **If the normalization is not declared, the trend is fiction.**
3. **WLNK beats wishful means.** Use weakest‑link folds for safety.
4. **Admit → Assert → Act.** (CN‑frame admission → RSG StateAssertion → Method step).
5. **Bridge or bust.** Cross‑context = Bridge with CL and loss notes.
6. **Steward writes, Certifier admits.** (SoD by design.)
7. **Charts are recipes.** Name the `MethodDescription` that made the number.
8. **Deprecate in the open.** CN‑frame cards carry DRR & retirement plans.
9. **Keep characteristics few, meanings sharp.** Prefer ≤ 7 characteristics per CN‑frame.
10. **No tooling names in Core.** Semantics first; notation later.
11. **Use method/instance IDs; avoid generic “map” nouns.** Prefer `NormalizationMethodId`/`NormalizationMethodInstanceId` (see the **A.19.UNM** lexical guard).

### A.19.CN:11 - SCR / RSCR Harness (acceptance & regression)

> **These are concept‑level checks; notation‑agnostic.**

#### A.19.CN:11.1 - **SCR — Acceptance (first introduction)**

* **SCR‑A19.4‑S01 (Completeness).** **CN‑Spec has **all** mandatory slots; `cs_basis` include **unit/scale/polarity**; `chart` references a `MethodDescription`.
* **SCR‑A19.4‑S02 (Normalization clarity).** `normalization` cites the UNM mechanism (`UNM_id?`) and provides the normalization references required by the UNM owner (methods / invariants / fix, and instances when used). If instances are referenced in assurance logs, their evidence/backing and validity constraints are handled by the owning evidence pattern (C.16), not by A.19.CN.
* **SCR‑A19.4‑S03 (Comparability test).** Provide one worked example showing **coordinatewise** or **normalization‑based** comparison end‑to‑end (with Evidence Graph Ref).
* **SCR‑A19.4‑S04 (Γ‑fold audit).** Aggregation rule spells out WLNK/COMM/LOC/MONO choices; reviewer reconstructs result on a toy set.
* **SCR‑A19.4‑S05 (SoD).** Distinct `RoleAssignments` for `CN‑frameStewardRole` and `CN‑frameCertifierRole` exist; windows do not overlap.
* **SCR‑A19.4‑S06 (describedEntity & anchors surfaced).** For each CN‑Spec characteristic used in the worked example, cite the corresponding CHR Characteristic name and the evidence anchor(s) (A.10) that make the reading observable in this Context.

#### A.19.CN:11.2 - **RSCR — Regression (on change)**

* **RSCR‑A19.4‑R01 (UNM edit).** On changing `normalization` (UNM/NormalizationMethod), flag **all** downstream Bridges for CL re‑assessment; re‑run example comparisons.
* **RSCR‑A19.4‑R02 (Slot surgery/Basis surgery).** Adding/removing/renaming slot/basis requires a **new edition**; old data remain valid **for their edition**.
* **RSCR‑A19.4‑R03 (Chart drift).** Updating measurement protocol bumps edition; **historic Work** keeps old edition link.
* **RSCR‑A19.4‑R04 (Fold change).** Any change to `Γ_fold` invalidates cached roll‑ups; re‑compute or mark as superseded.
* **RSCR‑A19.4‑R05 (Bridge health).** After either side’s edition change, **re‑validate** Bridge CL and loss notes before accepting Cross‑context data.
* **RSCR‑A19.4‑R06 (Deprecation rule).** On deprecating a CN‑frame, Registry lists its successor; bridges re‑targeted or retired.

### A.19.CN:12 - Interaction summary (wiring to the rest of the kernel)

* **A.2 / A.2.5 (Roles / RSG).** RSG **checklists** quote **CN‑Spec.acceptance**; enactment gates rely on **admitted** CN‑frame data.
* **B.1 (Γ‑algebra).** CN‑Spec’s `Γ_fold` instantiates Γ\_ctx/Γ\_time/WLNK/MONO choices explicitly.
* **B.3 (Assurance).** Bridge CL enters the **R** term; WLNK protects safety roll‑ups.
* **C.6 / C.7 (LOG‑CAL / CHR‑CAL).** Units, scales, and measurement templates come from CHR; proofs about folds live in LOG‑CAL.

### A.19.CN:13 - Minimal CN‑Spec template (copy/paste, informational)

**Template note (refs-only).** This template shows *slot placement* for governance. Token semantics for normalization belong to the UNM owner (A.19.UNM); indicatorization semantics belong to the indicatorization owner (e.g., A.19.UINDM); evidence/backing semantics belong to C.16; legality/evidence gates belong to G.0.

**Implementation note (non‑normative): conceptual audit fields.** (For implementation completeness only; not part of the CN‑Spec normative surface.) The goal is *auditability*: any implementation should be able to cite the relevant refs (CN‑Spec edition, evidence anchors, UNM instance refs, Bridge ids) when producing a `StateAssertion`. The normative semantics of normalization and evidence/backing are owned by the corresponding mechanism and evidence patterns (e.g., A.19.UNM and C.16). A.19.CN does not prescribe storage formats.

### A.19.CN:Close

A.19.CN gives A.19 some **teeth**: a *CN‑Spec* you can put on one page, a **Registry** that stops sprawl, **Bridges** that carry explicit loss, and a **checklist + harness** that make comparability **auditable**. It obeys the **mandatory pattern structure** of Part E (style, checklists, DRR, guard‑rails) while remaining tool‑agnostic and context‑local.
