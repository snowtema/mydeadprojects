## G.11 - Telemetry-Driven Refresh & Decay Orchestrator

**Tag.** Architectural pattern (architectural; notation-independent)
**Status.** Stable
**Normativity.** Normative (unless explicitly marked informative)

**Stage.** run-time + maintenance-time (selective re-computation, republication, and controlled deprecation)

**Primary outputs (kit surfaces).** `RefreshQueue`, `RefreshPlan@Context` (WorkPlanning artefact), `RefreshReport@Context` (Work/Audit artefact), `DeprecationNotice@Context`, `EditionBumpLog@Context`.

**Primary hooks.** `G.Core` (RSCR trigger catalogue + alias docking + default ownership index), `G.6` (EvidenceGraph; `PathId`/`PathSliceId`), `G.7` (Bridge Sentinels; CL/Φ/plane policy pins), `G.5` (set-returning selection/dispatch), `G.8` (SoS-LOGBundle telemetry hooks), `G.9` (parity reruns), `G.10` (shipping hooks and pack-level telemetry pins), `G.12` (dashboard telemetry pins), `B.3.4` (freshness/decay), `E.18` (GateCrossing/CrossingSurface visibility), optional `C.18/C.19` (QD/E–E policy pins), `C.23` (SoS-LOG branches / maturity ladders).

**Non-duplication note (Phase-2).**
This pattern **does not** (i) define the meaning of RSCR trigger kinds, (ii) introduce “shadow specs” for CN/CG legality, (iii) redefine tri-state guards / penalties / set-return semantics, (iv) re-own shipping or harvesting, or (v) mint new `RSCRTriggerKindId` / default owners (design-time changes live in `G.Core` and are recorded via DRR, `E.9`).
All such universal norms are **cited via `G.Core`** and enforced through **delegation** in this pattern’s conformance checklist.

### G.11:1 - Problem frame — Keeping shipped SoTA current without global rebuilds

Part G produces shipped, selector-ready artefacts (packs, bundles, evidence graphs, parity reports, dashboards). Once shipped, they are exposed to:

* **telemetry** (illumination/archive changes, parity outcomes, dashboard deltas),
* **decay** (freshness windows expire; epistemic debt grows),
* **edition drift** (descriptor/distance/transfer rules bump; policy pins evolve),
* **bridge evolution** (CL/plane penalties or calibrations update).

Without an explicit orchestration surface, refresh becomes either:

* a brittle set of ad-hoc “full rerun” rituals, or
* an audit-only posture that silently accumulates drift.

`G.11` is the **Part G owner** of the **refresh orchestration kit**: it turns typed refresh causes into **scoped plans** and **auditable execution reports**, while delegating all cause semantics and universal invariants to `G.Core`.

### G.11:2 - Problem — Why naive refresh breaks comparability and legality

A refresh loop fails (conceptually) when any of the following happens:

1. **Full-rerun mania.** Minor edits (e.g., a single Bridge calibration) trigger pack-wide rebuilds without a traceable scope rationale.
2. **Editionless telemetry.** Telemetry signals are recorded without edition pins, making reruns non-comparable and parity-unreplayable.
3. **Alias-as-semantics.** Legacy trigger labels (e.g., `T0…T7`) are treated as if they define meaning, fragmenting refresh semantics across patterns.
4. **Silent crossings.** Refresh actions implicitly change crossing assumptions (UTS/Path/policy pins) without a visible CrossingSurface.
5. **Orchestration smuggles semantics.** Refresh introduces new default behaviors (dominance/portfolio/Γ-fold) or coerces partial orders into scalars “for convenience.”

### G.11:3 - Forces — Minimal recomputation under strict invariants

* **Minimal scope vs. completeness.** Refresh must be *as local as possible* (slice-scoped), but still include a defensible dependency closure over evidence and crossings.
* **Operational urgency vs. auditability.** Refresh is triggered by run-time telemetry and decay, yet must remain auditable as Work (pins, refs, paths), not as opaque “decisions.”
* **Legacy stability vs. semantic unification.** Existing trigger labels must remain usable, but their meaning must be single-owner and id-based.
* **Modularity vs. orchestration power.** `G.11` must coordinate harvesting/parity/shipping without re-implementing them or importing discipline-specific method semantics into core.
* **Policy-bound behavior vs. “smart defaults.”** Ordering of refresh, priority heuristics, and budget handling are valuable—but must live as policy-bound extensions, not as hidden universal rules.

### G.11:4 - Solution — RSCR-driven refresh as a P2W-scoped orchestration surface

#### G.11:4.1 - G.Core linkage (normative)

**GCoreLinkageManifest (normative; canonical shape per `G.Core`; Nil‑elision permitted).**

`GCoreLinkageManifest := ⟨
  CoreConformanceProfileIds := {
    GCoreConformanceProfileId.PartG.AuthoringBase,
    GCoreConformanceProfileId.PartG.TriStateGuard,
    GCoreConformanceProfileId.PartG.UTSWhenPublicIdsMinted,
    GCoreConformanceProfileId.PartG.ShippingBoundary
  },

  RSCRTriggerSetIds := {GCoreTriggerSetId.RefreshOrchestration},

  CorePinSetIds := {
    GCorePinSetId.PartG.AuthoringMinimal,
    GCorePinSetId.PartG.CrossingVisibilityPins
  },

  CorePinsRequired := {
    RSCRTriggerKindId,
    RSCRTriggerAliasId?,
    scope: PathSliceId[] | PatternScopeId,
    payloadPins{…},

    RefreshPlanId,
    RefreshReportId,
    DeprecationNoticeId?,
    EditionBumpLogId?,

    SlotFillingsPlanItemRef[]?
  },

  DefaultsConsumed := ∅,
  TriggerAliasMapRef := G.Core.TriggerAliasMap.G11
⟩`

By the `G.Core` **Expansion rule**, the **effective** conformance ids / trigger‑kinds / pin‑obligations for `G.11` are the manifest expansions (profiles/sets/pin‑sets) plus the explicit deltas above.

**LegacyTriggerAliasIds (visible; labels only).** `{G.11:T0…T7}` (docked via `TriggerAliasMapRef`; aliases are never semantic authorities).

#### G.11:4.2 - Refresh orchestration kit (pattern-owned; conceptual surfaces)

`G.11` defines a minimal kit of *authoring-plane* artefacts that make refresh explicit and auditable.

1. **`RefreshQueue` (conceptual surface).**
   A queue of refresh candidates keyed by scope (`PathSliceId` preferred; `PatternScopeId` permitted).
   Ordering, prioritization, and batching are policy-bound (and therefore extension-scoped), but every queue item carries canonical trigger kind ids.

2. **`RefreshPlan@Context` (WorkPlanning artefact).**
   A planned refresh is a WorkPlanning object that **does not execute Work** and **does not embed gate decisions**. It declares:

* `RefreshPlanId` (UTS-published id; editioned)
* `describedEntity` and `ReferencePlane` pins (by ref; no implicit widening)
* `TargetScope := PathSliceId[] | PatternScopeId[]`
* `PlannedTriggers := RSCRTrigger[]` (canonical trigger kind ids + scope + payload pins)
* `PlannedActions := RefreshAction[]` (each action delegates to an owner pattern)
* `RequiredPins := {EditionPins, PolicyPins, UTS/Path pins}` for replayability
* `PlanItemRefs := SlotFillingsPlanItemRef[]` (when planning baselines or reruns requires explicit planned slot fillings)

3. **`RefreshReport@Context` (Work/Audit artefact).**
   An execution report (Work or Audit artefact) that records:

* `RefreshReportId` (UTS-published id; editioned)
* `ExecutedActions[]` with links to invoked owner artefacts (e.g., new parity report id, new pack id)
* `ObservedDeltas` (telemetry deltas, legality changes, evidence-path changes) as refs/pins—not as untyped prose
* `RSCRRefs[]` (any RSCR / regression harness artefacts invoked)
* `EmittedNotices[] := DeprecationNoticeId[]` and `EditionBumpLogId[]`
* the canonical trigger kinds actually applied (not only aliases)

4. **`DeprecationNotice@Context` and `EditionBumpLog@Context`.**
   Controlled evolution artefacts that preserve ID-continuity:

* **DeprecationNotice** explains scope, reason class (canonical trigger kind ids), and successor refs.
* **EditionBumpLog** records edition increments and the pins that justify them.

> *Note (normative by delegation).* ID continuity and alias discipline are governed by `G.Core` (do not restate as local rules here).

#### G.11:4.3 - Orchestration semantics (conceptual; delegating to owners)

`G.11` turns typed causes into scoped actions without owning the semantics of those actions.

**4.3.1 Ingestion.**
Consume RSCR triggers from:

* telemetry hooks (e.g., `G.8`, `G.10`, `G.12`),
* freshness/decay events (`B.3.4`),
* evidence/bridge/policy/edition edits (from the respective owners’ publication surfaces).

Every ingested signal is normalized into an `RSCRTrigger` (canonical id, scope, payload pins), with optional alias labels.

**4.3.2 Scope closure (EvidenceGraph-first).**
Compute the minimal dependency closure over:

* cited evidence paths (`G.6` `PathId/PathSliceId`),
* declared crossings (`G.7` sentinels; `CrossingSurface` visibility),
* and pinned contract surfaces (editions/policies).

The closure is a *planning-time claim* (“these slices are affected”), not a Work-time output.

**4.3.3 Planning (P2W seam).**
Produce `RefreshPlan@Context` that schedules actions of the form:

* `RerunHarvest` (delegates to `G.2`/`G.1`/owner; if used)
* `RerunParity` (delegates to `G.9`)
* `RecomputeSelectionOrPortfolio` (delegates to `G.5`)
* `RebindBridgeOrCrossing` (delegates to `G.7` and visibility harnesses)
* `UpdateEvidenceBindings` (delegates to `G.6`)
* `ReshipPack` (delegates to `G.10`)
* `UpdateBundle` (delegates to `G.8`)
* `UpdateDashboardSlice` (delegates to `G.12`)
* `EmitDeprecationNotice` / `EmitEditionBumpLog` (pattern-owned publication surfaces)

**4.3.4 Execution + audit.**
Execute planned actions as Work (or Work-bound audit) and publish `RefreshReport@Context`.
Gating outcomes (admit / degrade / abstain) follow `G.Core` tri-state semantics and are recorded via policy ids and cited evidence paths, rather than as local bespoke statuses.

#### G.11:4.4 - Extensions (pattern-scoped; non-core)

All discipline-specific refresh strategies, scheduling heuristics, and generator-specific wiring live as `GPatternExtension` blocks.

##### G.11:Ext.LegacyTriggers

**PatternScopeId:** `G.11:Ext.LegacyTriggers`
**GPatternExtensionId:** `LegacyTriggers`
**GPatternExtensionKind:** `InteropSpecific` (back-compat / alias docking)
**SemanticOwnerPatternId:** `G.Core`
**Uses:** `{G.Core}` (cites `G.Core.TriggerAliasMap.G11`)
**⊑/⊑⁺:** `∅`
**RequiredPins / EditionPins / PolicyPins (minimum):**

* `RSCRTriggerKindId[]` (canonical ids recorded on triggers)
* `RSCRTriggerAliasId?` (e.g., `G.11:T0…T7` as labels only)
* `scope: PathSliceId[] | PatternScopeId`

**RSCRTriggerKindIds:** `{RSCRTriggerKindId.EditionPinChange, RSCRTriggerKindId.PolicyPinChange, RSCRTriggerKindId.TelemetryDelta, RSCRTriggerKindId.FreshnessOrDecayEvent, RSCRTriggerKindId.CrossingSurfaceEdit, RSCRTriggerKindId.PenaltyPolicyEdit, RSCRTriggerKindId.MaturityRungChange, RSCRTriggerKindId.EvidenceSurfaceEdit}`
**Notes (wiring-only):** This block **does not define** what `T0…T7` mean; it only preserves the labels and requires docking via `G.Core.TriggerAliasMap.G11`.

##### G.11:Ext.DecayAndDebt

**PatternScopeId:** `G.11:Ext.DecayAndDebt`
**GPatternExtensionId:** `DecayAndDebt`
**GPatternExtensionKind:** `DisciplineSpecific`
**SemanticOwnerPatternId:** `B.3.4` (freshness/decay semantics)
**Uses:** `{B.3.4, G.6}`
**⊑/⊑⁺:** `∅`
**RequiredPins / EditionPins / PolicyPins (minimum):**

* `FreshnessWindowDeclRef` (or equivalent window pin, as defined by the owner)
* `DecayPolicyIdRef` / `EpistemicDebtBudgetRef` (policy-bound)
* `PathSliceId[]` (affected evidence carriers)

**RSCRTriggerKindIds:** `{RSCRTriggerKindId.FreshnessOrDecayEvent, RSCRTriggerKindId.EvidenceSurfaceEdit, RSCRTriggerKindId.BaselineBindingEdit}`
**Notes (wiring-only):** Any budget/priority logic remains policy-bound; `G.11` only wires decay events to refresh planning.

##### G.11:Ext.QDRefreshWiring

**PatternScopeId:** `G.11:Ext.QDRefreshWiring`
**GPatternExtensionId:** `QDRefreshWiring`
**GPatternExtensionKind:** `MethodSpecific`
**SemanticOwnerPatternId:** `C.18` (QD semantics; descriptor/distance/insertion)
**Uses:** `{C.18, C.19, G.5, G.8}`
**⊑/⊑⁺:** `∅`
**RequiredPins / EditionPins / PolicyPins (minimum):**

* `DescriptorMapRef.edition`, `DistanceDefRef.edition`
* `CharacteristicSpaceRef.edition?` (required when a domain-family coordinate is declared by the QD owner)
* `InsertionPolicyRef`, `EmitterPolicyRef` (policy-bound)
* `PathSliceId` (archive/illumination scope) + `policy-id` for emitted telemetry triggers

**RSCRTriggerKindIds:** `{RSCRTriggerKindId.TelemetryDelta, RSCRTriggerKindId.EditionPinChange, RSCRTriggerKindId.PolicyPinChange}`
**Notes (wiring-only):** `G.11` does not restate QD semantics; it ensures pins are present so reruns are comparable.

##### G.11:Ext.OEERefreshWiring

**PatternScopeId:** `G.11:Ext.OEERefreshWiring`
**GPatternExtensionId:** `OEERefreshWiring`
**GPatternExtensionKind:** `MethodSpecific`
**SemanticOwnerPatternId:** `C.19` (open-ended exploration / E–E logistics)
**Uses:** `{C.19, G.5, G.8, G.9}`
**⊑/⊑⁺:** `∅`
**RequiredPins / EditionPins / PolicyPins (minimum):**

* `TransferRulesRef.edition`, `EnvironmentValidityRegion` (when OEE is declared by the owner patterns)
* `GeneratorFamilyId` / `TransferRulesRef` wiring pins (as published by the owners)
* telemetry scope pins (`PathSliceId`, `policy-id`)

**RSCRTriggerKindIds:** `{RSCRTriggerKindId.EditionPinChange, RSCRTriggerKindId.TelemetryDelta, RSCRTriggerKindId.PolicyPinChange}`
**Notes (wiring-only):** Any OEE method semantics live with the owner; this module only wires refresh triggers to comparable reruns.

##### G.11:Ext.SchedulingHeuristics (Phase-3 seed)

**PatternScopeId:** `G.11:Ext.SchedulingHeuristics`
**GPatternExtensionId:** `SchedulingHeuristics`
**GPatternExtensionKind:** `Phase3Seed`
**SemanticOwnerPatternId:** `owner TBD`
**Uses:** `{G.11}`
**⊑/⊑⁺:** `∅`
**RequiredPins / EditionPins / PolicyPins (minimum):**

* `RefreshPriorityPolicyIdRef` (policy-bound)
* `BudgetDeclRef` (time/compute/cost/risk ceilings; policy-bound)

**RSCRTriggerKindIds:** `{RSCRTriggerKindId.TelemetryDelta, RSCRTriggerKindId.FreshnessOrDecayEvent, RSCRTriggerKindId.MaturityRungChange}`
**Notes (seed, non-normative):** Scheduling strategies (bandit-style, queueing, cadence policies) are valuable but must not become Part‑G‑wide norms.

### G.11:5 - Archetypal Grounding — System / Episteme (informative; Tell–Show–Show)

**`U.System` illustration — Safety-critical maintenance loop (pump + calibration).**
A centrifugal pump is serviced under a documented procedure (method description). Sensors report vibration drift (telemetry), and a calibration standard is updated (edition bump). `G.11` does not “rebuild the whole maintenance doctrine”: it emits a refresh plan scoped to the affected inspection slices (paths) and publishes a refresh report with pins to the updated standard edition and the evidence paths. Deprecation notices are issued for obsolete thresholds in the procedure’s acceptance clauses (by owner pattern), preserving ID continuity.

**`U.Episteme` illustration — Living review / benchmark pack (claims + parity).**
A claim sheet behind a shipped SoTA pack changes (new evidence, retraction, or revised measurement definition). Bridges are recalibrated, affecting CL/plane penalties. `G.11` ingests canonical trigger kinds, computes the minimal closure over affected `PathSliceId`s, schedules targeted parity reruns, then re-ships the pack through the shipping owner—while publishing an edition bump log that makes the evolution replayable.

### G.11:6 - Bias-Annotation (informative)

Lenses tested: **Gov**, **Arch**, **Onto/Epist**, **Prag**, **Did**.

* **Arch bias (toward explicit wiring).** Risk: authors feel “over-pinned.” Mitigation: keep the minimum pin set small; push scheduling sophistication into extensions/policies.
* **Gov bias (toward audit over speed).** Risk: refresh becomes bureaucratic. Mitigation: the kit is intentionally thin (queue/plan/report), while action semantics remain delegated to owners.
* **Onto/Epist bias (toward single-owner semantics).** Risk: teams try to localize trigger meaning for convenience. Mitigation: alias docking is allowed, but semantics stay in `G.Core`.
* **Prag bias (toward minimal recomputation).** Risk: under-refresh if closure is too narrow. Mitigation: require closure rationale and allow explicit “scope wideners” as policy-bound pins.
* **Did bias (toward readable, reusable artefacts).** Risk: oversimplified examples. Mitigation: maintain System+Episteme grounding and keep SoTA-echoing explicit.

### G.11:7 - Conformance Checklist (normative)

### G.11:8 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them (informative)

| Anti-pattern                       | Symptom                                                           | Why it fails                                             | Repair                                                                            |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Full-rerun mania**               | Any edit triggers a global rebuild                                | Costs explode; drift hides (no scope rationale)          | Enforce slice-scoped plans (CC‑G11.1); require closure rationale for global scope |
| **Editionless telemetry**          | Telemetry lacks `…Ref.edition`                                    | Reruns are non-comparable; parity breaks                 | Block publication on missing pins (CC‑G11.2)                                      |
| **Alias-as-semantics**             | `T*` labels are treated as meaning                                | Trigger meaning fragments; regressions become untestable | Dock aliases via `G.Core.TriggerAliasMap.G11`; record canonical ids               |
| **Silent crossing during refresh** | Refresh changes context/plane assumptions without crossings       | Violates crossing visibility; penalties become hidden    | Require crossing pins + E.18 visibility; block publication (CC‑G11.6)             |
| **Default smuggling**              | Refresh introduces “helpful” default dominance/portfolio behavior | Competing defaults appear; downstream arguments drift    | Cite owners via `G.Core.DefaultOwnership` (CC‑G11.8)                              |
| **Debt-by-prose**                  | “We decided not to refresh” exists only in narrative              | Not comparable; cannot be tested                         | Emit a DeprecationNotice (incl. a Waive outcome, if used) with pins (CC‑G11.7)    |

### G.11:9 - Consequences (informative)

* **Selective, replayable upkeep.** Refresh becomes a controlled planning/execution loop rather than an implicit “maintenance vibe.”
* **Stable semantics with flexible operations.** Trigger meaning is centralized (`G.Core`), while scheduling sophistication can evolve as policy-bound extensions.
* **Clear ownership boundaries.** Orchestration coordinates owners; it does not redefine their semantics (shipping remains `G.10`, selection remains `G.5`, etc.).
* **Cost: pin discipline overhead.** Authors must carry enough ids/editions/policies to make refresh comparable. This is intentional: it replaces hidden drift with explicit wiring.

### G.11:10 - Rationale (informative)

`G.11` is intentionally a **thin orchestration owner**:

* The refresh loop is powerful enough to coordinate reruns and republishing, but **too thin to become a second spec**. That is why trigger semantics, invariants, and defaults are delegated to `G.Core`.
* The kit is split across the **P2W seam** so that planning artefacts remain planning artefacts and executed work remains auditably executed work.
* Legacy stability is maintained by allowing trigger aliases (`T0…T7`) while prohibiting them from becoming semantic authorities.

### G.11:11 - SoTA-Echoing — Post‑2015 practices aligned (informative)

Each entry follows: **claim → practice → source → alignment → adoption status**.

1. **Continuous refresh is necessary in deployed evaluation pipelines.**
   Practice: production ML systems use monitoring + retraining / reevaluation triggers and insist on reproducibility hooks.
   Source: Breck et al., *The ML Test Score* (2017); Amershi et al., *Software Engineering for Machine Learning* (2019).
   Alignment: `G.11` formalizes triggers as typed causes and forces edition/policy pins for replay.
   Adoption: **Adopt/Adapt** (adapted to id-based, PathSlice-scoped refresh rather than “retrain everything”).

2. **Non-stationarity requires explicit drift/decay handling, not ad-hoc updates.**
   Practice: continual learning emphasizes non-stationarity as a first-class maintenance condition.
   Source: Parisi et al., *Continual Lifelong Learning with Neural Networks* (2019); De Lange et al., *A Continual Learning Survey* (2021).
   Alignment: `B.3.4` supplies decay semantics; `G.11` wires decay events into refresh planning and controlled deprecation.
   Adoption: **Adapt** (refresh of conceptual artefacts and evidence closures, not untracked model mutation).

3. **Quality-Diversity requires archive semantics and comparability under descriptor/distance evolution.**
   Practice: QD methods treat the archive as the primary result and track changes under policy/edition conditions.
   Source: contemporary QD families such as CMA‑ME (post‑2018) and differentiable QD lines (post‑2019).
   Alignment: QD-specific meaning lives with the owner patterns; `G.11:Ext.QDRefreshWiring` ensures edition pins and scope pins exist so targeted archive refresh is lawful.
   Adoption: **Adopt** (set/archive preservation; no covert scalarization).

4. **Open-endedness co-evolves environments and agents; transfer rules must be versioned.**
   Practice: POET-class open-ended systems require explicit transfer rules and environment validity constraints.
   Source: Wang et al., POET (2019) and subsequent POET extensions (2020+).
   Alignment: `G.11:Ext.OEERefreshWiring` requires `TransferRulesRef.edition` and scope pins so refresh reruns remain comparable and auditable.
   Adoption: **Adopt/Adapt** (adapted to Part‑G pin/UTS publication discipline).

5. **Efficient orchestration benefits from bandit/early-stopping scheduling—but it must not become semantics.**
   Practice: modern hyperparameter/experiment scheduling uses bandit-style resource allocation and asynchronous early stopping.
   Source: Async Hyperband / BOHB-style work (2018+) as representative post‑2015 scheduling practice.
   Alignment: scheduling lives as policy-bound extension (`G.11:Ext.SchedulingHeuristics`) so core semantics remain stable.
   Adoption: **Adapt** (useful practice, but quarantined outside core norms).

### G.11:12 - Relations

**Builds on:** `G.Core` (Part‑G invariants; RSCR trigger catalogue; alias docking; default ownership index), `G.6` (EvidenceGraph, `PathId/PathSliceId`), `G.7` (Bridge sentinels; CL/Φ/plane pins), `G.5` (selector & set-return), `G.8` (bundle telemetry hooks), `G.9` (parity), `G.10` (shipping hooks), `B.3.4` (freshness/decay), `E.18` (GateCrossing visibility).
**Coordinates with:** `G.12` (dashboard telemetry pins), optional `C.18/C.19` (QD/E–E pins), `C.23` (SoS-LOG branches and maturity ladders), `F.15` (RSCR harness surfaces, when present).
**Publishes to:** UTS (refresh plan/report, deprecations, edition bumps), and to the relevant owner patterns’ publication surfaces via delegated actions.
