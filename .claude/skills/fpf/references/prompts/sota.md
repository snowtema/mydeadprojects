# SoTA Harvesting & Discipline Packs

## Goal

Use FPF Part G to organize a frontier discipline around first principles and state-of-the-art practices.

## Prompt Template

```
We are in search for SoTA of <discipline>.
Using G.2 and G.4, extract: 
(a) TraditionCards for competing schools of thought; 
(b) OperatorCards for their main operators / update rules; 
(c) a first draft of a SoTA Pack and selector-ready portfolio. 

This is expected to be a long text, therefore start with only TraditionCards.
```

## Related Patterns

- **G.2** - SoTA Harvester & Synthesis
- **G.4** - CAL Authoring for a CG-Frame (Operators)
- **G.0** - Frame Standard & Comparability Governance
- **G.1** - CG-Frame-Ready Generator

## When to Use

- Surveying state-of-the-art in a new domain
- Comparing competing methodologies or frameworks
- Building discipline-specific knowledge packs
- Creating method selector tools for teams

## SoTA Pack Components

### TraditionCards
Document competing schools of thought:
- **Name**: Tradition identifier
- **Core Principles**: Foundational assumptions
- **Key Operators**: Signature moves/patterns
- **Scope**: Where it applies best
- **Limitations**: Known weaknesses

### OperatorCards
Catalog transformation rules:
- **Operator Name**: What it's called
- **Input/Output Types**: What it transforms
- **Preconditions**: When it's valid
- **Update Rules**: How it works
- **Evidence**: Where it's proven effective

### Selector-Ready Portfolio
Decision support for method choice:
- **Context Matching**: Which tradition fits this problem?
- **Composition Rules**: Can we combine traditions?
- **Conflict Resolution**: When traditions disagree
- **Evolution Tracking**: How traditions are improving

## Harvesting Process

1. **Survey**: Identify major traditions in discipline
2. **Extract**: Create TraditionCards for each
3. **Analyze**: Build OperatorCards for key patterns
4. **Synthesize**: Construct selector portfolio
5. **Validate**: Test against real-world cases
6. **Maintain**: Track evolution and updates
