# Characterisation & Indicators for a New Project

## Goal

Get a step-by-step chain from "vague idea" to measurable characteristics, indicators, scoring and decision criteria.

## Prompt Template

```
You should be using FPF skill.  
We are starting work on <brief description of project>, design has not yet begun.  
Propose a step-by-step chain for characterising the objects of our project, normalising measurements, defining indicators, scoring alternatives, and choosing design decisions.  
Include steps that I may have forgotten.  
Write in the language of engineer-managers, not in FPF jargon.
```

## Typical Follow-ups

**Detail a specific object:**
```
Now take object <X> from this chain and work it through in detail: list 10–15 characteristics, their scales, indicators, and a rough dashboard format for decision-makers.
```

**Map to P2W architecture:**
```
Show how this chain maps to P2W in E.TGA for this project.
```

## When to Use

- Starting a new project with unclear requirements
- Converting vague stakeholder goals into measurable targets
- Establishing decision criteria before design begins
- Creating dashboards for tracking project health
