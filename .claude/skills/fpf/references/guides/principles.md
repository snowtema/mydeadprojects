# Core FPF Principles

Quick reference for essential patterns. Load full content from domain indexes when needed.

## A.7 Strict Distinction
**Domain**: foundations | **Path**: `references/fpf-patterns/foundations/A.7_strict_distinction_clarity_lattice.md`

Map != Territory. Plan (MethodDescription) != Execution (Work).
Never confuse what you plan to do with what actually happened.

## A.10 Evidence Graph
**Domain**: trust-evidence | **Path**: `references/fpf-patterns/trust-evidence/A.10_evidence_graph_referring_c4.md`

All claims need auditable evidence chains. Cite sources.
Every assertion should be traceable to its origin.

## B.3 Trust Calculus (F-G-R)
**Domain**: trust-evidence | **Path**: `references/fpf-patterns/trust-evidence/B.3_trust_assurance_calculus_fgr_with_congruence.md`

Assess reliability of sources and claims:
- **Formality**: How rigorous/formal is the source?
- **Granularity**: How specific/detailed is the information?
- **Reliability**: How trustworthy is the source?

## B.5 Reasoning Cycle
**Domain**: reasoning | **Path**: `references/fpf-patterns/reasoning/B.5_canonical_reasoning_cycle.md`

- **Abduction**: Generate hypotheses from observations (creative inference)
- **Deduction**: Derive predictions from hypotheses (logical necessity)
- **Induction**: Test predictions against evidence (probabilistic validation)

## Additional Key Patterns

**For Terminology & Naming:**
- **F.17** - Unified Term Sheet (UTS) | See: [uts.md](../prompts/uts.md)
- **F.18** - Naming Protocol (Name Cards) | See: [naming.md](../prompts/naming.md)

**For Architecture & Flow:**
- **E.18** - Transduction Graph Architecture (E.TGA) | See: [p2w.md](../prompts/p2w.md)
- **C.16** - Measurement & Indicators | See: [characterisation.md](../prompts/characterisation.md)

**For SoTA & Disciplines:**
- **G.2** - SoTA Harvester | See: [sota.md](../prompts/sota.md)
- **G.4** - CAL Authoring | See: [sota.md](../prompts/sota.md)

## Loading Full Patterns

For detailed pattern content:
1. Navigate to domain index (e.g., `references/fpf-patterns/trust-evidence/index.md`)
2. Find pattern in TOC
3. Load specific pattern file
